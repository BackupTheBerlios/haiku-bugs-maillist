Comment:

 I have rebuild the modules with your changes and tried following test
 scenarios:

 1) Boot Haiku without external ps2 devices. The keyboard stay active
 (unfreezes) about 20 seconds after main Terminal window appears on the
 screen. All this time I push the key &quot;i&quot; every second. Just after first
 &quot;i&quot; symbol was displayed in Terminal I have stopped typing and rebooted
 the system. Attached &quot;syslog.with.inbound.keyboard&quot; file is slightly
 purged system log for this test.

 2) Boot Haiku with external keyboard attached to extension ps2 port of my
 laptop. Now, the external keyboard become available just after Terminal
 opens. The inbound keyboard still require that 20-seconds delay for
 activation. Both inbound and external keyboards are functional
 simultaneously. Attached &quot;syslog.external.keyboard&quot; file represent tracing
 for this test.

 3) Boot Haiku without external keyboard attached to ps2 extension port.
 After Tracker  windows appear on the screen I plugged the external
 keyboard into ps2 port. This keyboard is become active and functional just
 after plugging. But inbound keyboard still &quot;wait&quot; for 20 seconds before
 activation. Both inbound and external keyboards are functional
 simultaneously.

 4) The last test I have provided - is booting Haiku with attached external
 keyboard and plugging it out after system finish to boot. The inbound
 keyboard is also available in this scenario. Of course after this
 20-seconds delay. I have plugged the external keyboard back to port and it
 becomes available too. Do you want to look into tracing for this and
 previous tests?

 In other words it works now. Thank you.

 By the way this &quot;initial&quot; 20-seconds delay is still exists. It is not
 observed with the same hardware on BeOS R5. It is a bit annoying but not
 critical. May be you have idea about the source of this delay?
 I do not think that is related to this bug. Probably I should write
 another ticket for this problem with lower priority?
