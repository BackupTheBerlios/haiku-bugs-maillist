<PRE>#1185: Yet another story about non-working ps2 keyboards on laptop.
----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
 Reporter:  siarzhuk              |       Owner:  marcusoverhagen
     Type:  bug                   |      Status:  new            
 Priority:  high                  |   Milestone:  R1             
Component:  Drivers/Keyboard/PS2  |     Version:  R1 development 
 Platform:  All                   |  
----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
 This problem is observed on sis620-based laptop.

 The Problem: Inbound keyboard doesn't work. External one, attached to ps/2
 extension port has the same problem. Keyboard mode LEDs (Num Lock, Caps
 Lock etc.) are off and don't react on corresponding keys.
 Both inbound (Synaptic) touchpad connected to ps/2 bus and external ps/2
 mouse at mentioned above extension port are working OK. The problem is
 observed only with keyboards.

 The syslog acquired with activated in ps2 bus manager extra debug trace
 info is attached. The only editing I made - removing a lot of same &quot;mouse
 events&quot; blocks to reduce the size. The system was boot without any devices
 attached to ps2 extension port. In other words only inbound keyboard and
 touchpad were used during this test. No other modules were removed from
 the Haiku partition before the test. The Haiku was installed on this
 partition typically by jam build.

 NOTE: This problem arise on my laptop about 3-4 months ago. Before this
 time, the ps2 keyboard was working almost OK. There were some timeouts
 before keyboards become available. In other words after Haiku loaded
 completely I have to wait about 20-30 seconds before keyboard become
 available. Both Tracker and Terminal windows at this time already opened.
 Only keyboard was &quot;dead&quot;.

 Please let me know if you need an additional info or more debugging and
 testing. Hope this information help you to resolve the problem.
