Comment(by haiqu):

 Stefan, Most of the code faults I'm talking about in updates are not
 system-specific at all. I'm talking about missing header declarations,
 missing semicolons (yes, even from your updates) and pretty obvious stuff.
 And they do happen with great regularity, I wasn't over-estimating the
 ratio of clean builds to faults. There are also outstanding reports of
 numerous system-crippling and crashing bugs which apparently no-one has
 tackled as yet. If you insist on building and operating in a Linux
 environment, you probably never *will* see them, but I'm using Haiku as a
 day-to-day development environment now.

 It's all very well to take a superior attitude if you're perfect, but none
 of us are. Going on about how YOUR time is being wasted is ridiculous when
 you realize that one error in the repository affects everyone who
 downloads it. Thus, if I see what I think is a fault I report it
 immediately. Even if I regularly got it wrong 50% of the time the payback
 in lost developer time would be well worth the effort. On that note, and
 having already pointed out several times that I'm providing as much
 information as I either: a) have available, or b) think is relevant to the
 faults being described, all I can say is that you are again browbeating
 and lecturing. You have a choice, either accept bug reports or don't, but
 knock off the damned whining.

 On another note: I'm working on a lot more than just a TV card, but don't
 usually make announcements until I have a working product. But since one
 of my specialities is DSP and software-defined radio I've been looking
 into porting an MP4 Enhanced HE-AAC+ (or if you prefer, AAC v2) decoder
 library. Australia has settled on the DAB standard for radio so I'm going
 to need that soon.
