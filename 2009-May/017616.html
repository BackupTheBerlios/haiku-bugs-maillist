Comment(by pacman):

 Replying to [comment:23 axeld]:
 &gt; Stippi, about acceleration in general on older systems: unlike new
 systems, they have, in today's standards, an insanely limited memory
 bandwidth. So many things, most notably moving windows around, or
 scrolling, can still be done a lot faster using the hardware acceleration
 than you could do via software.

 This is only generally true for PCI cards, which will often be limited to
 40-60 MB/s write speed or less. On very bad motherboards this may drop to
 20 MB/s or so, if the PCI implementation is buggy.

 On AGP cards, you generally get 200+ MB/s write speed unless AGP is
 improperly configured. With write combining and fast writes, 200 MB/s is
 pretty much the lower bound (but 130MB/s has been observed on one of
 Rudolfs systems, a TNT-1/AGPx1 on Intel 400 BX). These low values only
 happen on cards so old that they will run only in very low resolutions
 anyway, which negates the effect from the low bandwidth. Most AGP cards
 can easily write 400-1000 MB/s, which is enough bandwith even for higher
 resolutions.
 Note: this only goes for writes, reads are insanely slow on AGP. 13 MB/s
 is the fastest I've ever seen for that; 5 MB/s seems to be normal.

 With 200 MB/s write, you can push 60 full 1024x768 32-bit screen updates
 per second; I think this should be enough for most scenarios (you'll
 rarely need full screen updates).

 One thing: to reach the maximum bandwith, write combining has to be
 properly configured. Without WC, write speeds depends on operand size, and
 there are drastic differences between using 64/32/8-bit operands.
 The relationships between WC/FW combinations and write speeds are a bit...
 strange. The only way to find optimum settings will be testing on many
 different machines - speeds can be influenced by hardware bugs/suboptimal
 implemenation of AGP specs by mainboard or graphics card manufacturer.

 I have some older GfxBussBench results from my own and Rudolfs machines
 lying around in the GfxBusBench sources; I'll see that I dust that off as
 soon as I find the time. I'm willing to donate GfxBusBench to Haiku (as
 Rudolf already stated, it runs without changes) if there's interest. There
 might be a need to rework the command line parameters or such, but the
 core should be reliable.

 &gt; This is where we might want to improve our acceleration usage (if
 possible) - this will definitely be faster on &quot;slow&quot; machines. The other
 stuff isn't so bad when ignored.

 As long as support for PCI and AGPx1 cards is desired, yes. For all other
 cards, correct configuration of write combining and AGP fast writes should
 basically always give sufficient bandwith for working without hw
 acceleration.
