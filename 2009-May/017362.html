Comment(by stippi):

 Hi Rudolf,

 there are several things which led me to disable the acceleration engine:

 * On my two computers which have native drivers, Haiku worked much
 smoother when acceleration was disabled. Haiku uses a lot more blending
 operations than BeOS did. So it needs to read the frame buffer a lot more.
 This is insanely slow. Using a frame shadow buffer in main memory and
 performing write operations on the frame buffer only is much faster.

 * I do not really want to go back to the 90ish style user interface look
 and use no gradients and thereby less B_OP_OVER for text rendering for
 example.

 * When dragging icons or dragging the selection rect in Tracker, it
 performs alpha blending. It flickers in BeOS when stuff redraws
 underneath, not in Haiku.

 * When repainting windows, Haiku uses double buffering, which means a
 whole lot less flickering in all sorts of situations, especially when
 repainting.

 * I cannot believe that when something feels slower on a fast computer,
 that it doesn't also feel slower on a slow computer. For the way in which
 the Haiku app_server currently works, using acceleration made it feel
 slower. It may be a problem of how it uses the acceleration, but I have no
 time or motivation to investigate. And blending will still feel slower.

 * I don't like the BeOS accelerant API. It is totally inflexible. Instead
 of performing commands with frame buffer coordinates, it should instead
 allow me to specify frame buffer (and offscreen!) memory addresses.

 * Eventually, the app_server should use 3D acceleration to do window
 compositing and use a lot less CPU, because there wouldn't be anymore
 redraws because of exposing previously covered up window regions.

 * This task is way too big for me to tackle right now. On all my
 computers, Haiku feels reasonably fast without any acceleration, including
 one pretty slowish computer. I see much more pressing needs in Haiku, like
 MediaKit encoding and the like.

 * If you want to figure out what I am doing wrong in the Haiku app_server
 which triggers weird lock ups of the NVidea driver when acceleration is
 used, please help analyze the app_server code. It is all pretty well
 written and should be easy to follow. There are only very few classes
 involved with repainting. It's DrawingEngine, HWInterface and
 AccelerantHWInterface. One needs to know that there is one DrawingEngine
 per Window, and one global AccelerantHWInterface instance. So there might
 be issues with locking when using acceleration. It does use locking, but
 it may use the wrong kind. I have no idea.

 I hope you have a better understanding now of why I think I did the right
 thing for the time being.
