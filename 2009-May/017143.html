Comment(by stippi):

 Thanks for the reply, I was a bit worried I may have went to far...

 It is clear to me from your replies that you cannot take critique or even
 honest polite suggestions at all. It just comes across as lecturing to you
 and you will not move a millimeter. I am actually a person with great
 desire for harmony and resolving conflicts. So when I try to be polite it
 may be because I am trying to discuss on a reasonable level and take away
 some of the heated emotions so that I may get my point across. Obviously
 doesn't work with you and I get no credit for it and are just being
 insulted for feeling superior over others. Your attitude that I couldn't
 possibly know more than you just says it all. Don't take me wrong, I am
 not saying that I actually do know more than you, but your attitude just
 makes it clear why you would never take any advice from me on how you
 could do something better. Boy, I sure hope I will not be that arrogant
 and stubborn when I am older.

 It probably doesn't work when I try to tell you that my honest intentions
 were to tell you what you could improve in your communication in the
 future. Which is that you try to put yourself into other peoples place and
 try to give them all the information which you can guess they may need,
 when you try really hard to guess. Like when there is possibly a syntax
 error in a file you created that you actually post the complete file in
 the first place and not make other people write three or more comments
 until they finally get something from you that they can work with. That
 sort of stuff. And I think with this background, my remark about you
 wasting precious time with this behavior was long overdue. But instead of
 simply acknowledging that, you come back with your 8/10 insult and how we
 morons waste everyones time with our untested work.
