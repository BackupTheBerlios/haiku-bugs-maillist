Comment(by rudolfc):

 Hi,

 That's good news.

 About the static: this indicates that not enough RAM bandwidth is
 available to feed the DAC consistently with data during RAM accesses from
 the main system. This is not related to the problem you had, but should
 not be anyway:

 You can try a few things:
 - modify nvidia.settings. Please select:
 'usebios true'.
 This let's the driver run the card as it was inited by it's BIOS at POST
 time. It might be there's slightly more bandwidth available then.

 BTW: you should also select: 'dma_acc true'. Though it isn't used atm,
 it's working much better than PIO mode. Also, on NV40 and later, PIO mode
 doesn't work at all.


 - try 16 bit colordepth. This halves the bandwidth needed. Problem gone?
 - try 8 bit colordepth if 16 bit did not help. OK?

 If you see that it's OK in the lower colordepth, but you can't solve it in
 32bit mode by setting 'usebios true',

 There's only one option left atm: you could tweak the RAM clock, on your
 own risk of course!
 From the log you uploaded which executed the coldstart scripts, you can
 gather that your GPU speed is set at 250Mhz, and the RAM clock at 400Mhz.

 Try to up your RAM speed by say 5%, so around 420Mhz. Does that influence
 the static in a positive manner? If so, and your card remains stable, you
 could try 10%, 440Mhz.

 I wouldn't go further than that though..

 ----

 I expect in Windows you don't have that problem in 1920x1080 @ 60Hz in
 32bit depth. Correct?
 This could mean the clock is higher in windows too, but it could also mean
 that in windows there's a (better) algorithm in the driver to share the
 bandwidth between sys access and DAC access (prioritizing). This is
 something I'd rather not setup since little is known about the inner
 workings of that mechanism.

 What you can also try is lowering the refreshrate below 60Hz: the lower,
 the less bandwidth is required. If you are on a flatpanel (you are I'd
 say) then 50Hz still offers a steady picture I guess.

 OK, lots of things for you to try ;-)

 Keep me posted please!

 Rudolf.
