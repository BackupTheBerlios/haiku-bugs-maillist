<PRE>#4560: Hardware/Software configuration app for users to report known good/bad
hardware/software
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
 Reporter:  JonathanThompson  |       Owner:  axeld    
     Type:  enhancement       |      Status:  new      
 Priority:  normal            |   Milestone:  R1       
Component:  - General         |     Version:  R1/alpha1
Blockedby:                    |    Platform:  All      
 Blocking:                    |  
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
 More than one user has asked: where do I find a known working hardware
 list?  Another has asked: where do I fill out that information?

 Because it can be a real nightmare to decipher things based on random
 input things, here is what I propose would be incredibly useful:  an app
 that's in the Applications folder called &quot;Report Hardware/Software
 Configurations&quot; (feel free to call it whatever you want that works better)
 that does exactly that, in a user-friendly manner.

 Here's what it would need to gather from the user:
 1.  Output from listdev
 2.  Output from listusb
 3.  User-friendly  descriptions of their particular hardware by
 make/model, since there are many embedded peripherals that are used in
 different things, and it'd be nice to know such things.  This would be
 entered by the user themselves, though they can always shrug off and
 ignore typing it.
 4.  Preferably the output of some benchmark applications that test all
 this stuff: even nicer (but not vital) would be performance results of
 said hardware doing various tests.
 5.  OS revision number, and also MD5 checksums of drivers installed.  Why
 the MD5?  Because some users may create custom drivers themselves, or grab
 them from different revisions, because the revision they're currently
 using fails on that hardware/driver combination.  The OS revision number,
 along with all this other information, would also make it very easy to
 track down what changes broke certain hardware/software support down to
 smaller revision ranges.

 Now, there's also a haiku-os.org side of things: it needs to break all
 these items down into a user-searchable list, both in a total system, as
 well as items in isolation, so people can get a better idea of what's
 known to work or not.  Also, provide a web form for filling out what
 absolutely won't install for hardware, since they won't be running Haiku
 to do so.
