Comment(by mmlr):

 Well, it's certainly nice to have a list of supported hardware from an end
 user side of things. But from the developer viewpoint working hardware is
 pretty uninteresting. The end goal is to have all hardware that is
 supported by our drivers, to be working. Anything else shouldn't be noted
 as non-working in some hardware database, but documented as bugs on this
 bug tracker so the issue can be fixed. I realize that sounds pretty bold,
 but it's really what we are most interested in right now, things that
 don't work as expected. If I for example knew that USB works for you, that
 might give me a &quot;well done&quot; kind of feeling, but if it works for you, then
 there really isn't anything to do for me, so I don't really need to know.

 An easy, automated way of submitting hardware information like you've
 proposed in the other ticket makes a lot of sense. The important thing is
 that things flagged non-working need to be properly reported, i.e. cause
 tickets to be created if they really should be supported by an existing
 driver. This makes it a bit more complicated. It would be pretty bad if
 testers would simply flag stuff &quot;non-working&quot; and be done with it, because
 we then don't get a lot of info that would be possibly be needed. If they
 create a ticket instead, we have a communication mechanism to ask back for
 extra information. In the long run, as in when we are heading to R1, we do
 need an official hardware database so users can check pre-install for the
 likelihood of Haiku running. For the first alpha though the motto pretty
 much was &quot;install everywhere and report things that aren't working&quot; rather
 than a finer grained approach.

 If you or anyone has the time to work on such a system, it'd be most
 appreciated of course, it's just that noone of use managed to pull it off
 for now. As you noted it is also a two-fold task as in, it needs a Haiku
 and a web part, which not everyone might be capable of implementing in an
 efficient way.
