Comment(by stippi):

 The first of your tests should have definitely worked. I tested this
 myself, like I already wrote. What modifier did you hold down to select
 the additional item? What modifier is configured as your short-cut key?

 The second of the tests is currently not supported. I am not sure if other
 platforms support this, although it would be nice. The current behavior is
 to always form a block between the top-most selected item and the bottom-
 most selected item. What you want is probably to use the last selected
 item as anchor and make a block selection from it to the clicked item. I
 would want to check how that works on other platforms first. In Windows
 Vista, selecting a block with Shift, then selecting one more item with
 Ctrl (so there is a gap between the last selected item and the block) and
 then Shift-clicking on yet another item farther down, will deselect the
 block and select a new block between the third clicked item and the forth.
 I think it would be nicer to have two blocks as a result, considering you
 selected the third item with Ctrl. If I wanted to get rid of the first
 block, why would I select the third item with Ctrl pressed instead of
 simply clicking it to start a whole new selection? (BTW, Natilus works the
 same.)
