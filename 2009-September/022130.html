&gt;<i> Try this: use Find to construct a query which returns several jpeg

</I>&gt;<i> entries in the query results window to open it in ShowImage. Now run
</I>&gt;<i> ShowImage's Slide Show feature and see what range of pictures you get.

</I>&gt;<i> It *almost* works. That is, the slide show scrolls through the files in
</I>&gt;<i> the query results window as though it were a regular Tracker folder and
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the files' real locations - until it has displayed the last
</I>&gt;<i> file, when it jumps into that file's real location, and displays any
</I>&gt;<i> pictures in that folder which follow it alphabetically. If I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> explained that very well, the attached screenshot should make it clear:
</I>&gt;<i> I've got two folders containing jpegs; also a query results window
</I>&gt;<i> picking three particular files from those two folders. Now if I double-

</I>&gt;<i> slideshow, it should rotate through Lily00029.jpg, MrPink and
</I>&gt;<i> R0012584.JPG. In fact it gives me those three plus Shrub00019.jpg and

 It *almost* works. That is, the slide show scrolls through the files in
 the query results window as though it were a regular Tracker folder and

 This is long-standing behaviour, of course; I've been using ShowImage in

 quite work as I think they should. But I've only recently figured out
