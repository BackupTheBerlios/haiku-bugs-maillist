 &gt; No you didn't miss anything, Create and Delete and still showing as (not
 &gt; implemented).

 Correct. It's not only DriveSetup, the problem is the unfinished disk
 device add-ons (with regard to write support). There are two add-ons, one
 for &quot;Intel Partition Map&quot;, which handles (the four) primary partitions and
 &quot;Intel Extended Partition&quot;, which handles &quot;logical partitions&quot; when one of
 the primary is an extended partition. The later is unfinished and the
 former could use some work as well. Initially, I was on the wrong track
 with regards to representing the options in DriveSetup. For example, there
 is no such thing as a &quot;logical partition&quot; in the on disk structures. There
 is multiple conventions for partition layout, different operating systems
 support different stuff, a great potential for screw ups here. So I didn't
 explore this any further for the time being, I have a pile of uncommited
 changes that I did before realizing there are no &quot;logical partitions&quot; (as
 a
 type). When a partition is created, it is actually created with the type
 of
 the file system, I thought one could create a partition and then decide on
 the file system, wrong. Need to get back to that sometimes...

 help,24 misc thread] from [haiku]:
 I've looked into this before and some of the stuff which is missing in the
 kernel is really not obvious. I tried to start with a clean drive, but
 there is already a problem, the Haiku kernel does not assign a disk system
 (Intel Partition Map?, EFI GUID?, Amiga Disk System?) to that. But most
 operations, like even getting the list of available disk systems in a user
 program, require a valid object hierarchy in the kernel. Personally, I
 don't regard it as critical for Alpha1 but it would be nice if someone
 finally tackled this for real. It must be done sometimes... :-) Maybe Ingo
 and I could both mentor this.

 &gt; How do you initialise a partition as BFS?
 The disk system has to be already established. Ie it needs to be Intel
 Partition Map, and the partition needs to exist. At least DriveSetup
 allows you to initializes whole drives, but then there is no disk system.
 The file system in this case starts at offset 0. No MBR or anything like
 that. Why initializing doesn't work in your particular case, I do not
 know.
