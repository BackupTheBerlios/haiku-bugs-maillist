Comment (by bonefish):

 Replying to [comment:1 axeld]:
 &gt; Did you ever run low on memory during working?

 Usually after a while of working the ProcessController memory bar is full
 and red. So I suppose it could very well be that in all instances this was
 the case too.

 &gt; Were these newly created files?

 The recent occurrences definitely were. I recall several times that a
 Makefile created by the binutils/gcc build system would suddenly contain
 binary data. I had a case where a header file from the texinfo sources was
 broken. I didn't edit it before, but I think I unzipped the sources
 earlier in the same session, so that file was newly created in the
 session, too.

 I defintely had one occurrence when a perl source file that was not new
 was garbled. This was before your recent BFS journal related fixes,
 though, and I may have had to terminate an earlier session without
 syncing. So this might not be related.

 &gt; Because if you didn't, the files would be kept in memory all the time,
 and therefore, something would actively clobber it.
 &gt;
 &gt; If they were new files and memory was low, eventually something marked
 the pages as clean, so they would never be written back to disk. Does that
 garbage look like something that might have been on disk previously?

 I didn't examine that any closer, also not whether the garbage was page
 size. Will do the next time I encounter the problem.

 I guess a small test suite straining FS/file cache/VM would be a good
 idea. There still seem to be a few issues with those and when encountering
 those in the &quot;wild&quot; one usually is doing something else and is not really
 motivated to examine the problem.
