Comment:

 Replying to [comment:1 axeld]:
 &gt; I haven't found much time to look into this, but this looks like
 environment variables. And those aren't only part of userland apps, but
 also copied inside the kernel when a new app launches (see team.cpp
 create_team_arg()).

 Yep, those definitely are environment variables, but this isn't an intact
 array. Different variables have been written on top of each other. The
 longest is BEINCLUDES, on top of it is probably PATH, on top of it
 something containing the perl test directory path, then some empty
 variable, on top of that &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2&quot; and on top of that
 &quot;EMXSHELL=sh&quot;. The latter two are definitely set only by t/TEST (in that
 order). That's why I was more thinking of some kind of buffer that perl
 uses internally.

 &gt; Since parts of this page are filled with 0xcccccccc, it might have been
 handed out by the kernel allocator, not the userland allocator (only the
 former fills it with 0xcc).

 Good point! I thought the userland allocator did that too.

 &gt; And since we found it in the middle of a hashtable allocation, and it's
 still filled with 0xcc, I'd say the kernel allocator has given this page
 away twice. It's just the question if it has been mapped twice (as you
 assumed), or if there is a bug in the heap implementation.

 I'm having the suspicion that the page wasn't mapped twice after all, but
 that the kernel allocator did indeed hand out the chunk of memory more
 than once. It probably even kept doing that. That would perfectly explain
 that memory contents: First the hash table gets the chunk, clears it and
 repopulates the table. Later another large allocation gets the same chunk
 and causes the table to be 0xcc'd again. Later an environment array is
 copied from userland during an exec() call, each string being copied over
 the previous one.

 &gt; Note also that the cache uses hash_insert_grow() which means the memory
 of the hash table might change over time.

 Yep, I noticed that. The hash table already contains 2622 entries, though,
 so the last rehashing was already almost 400 entries ago. Since the table
 contains complete garbage only, I'd suspect that the trouble started only
 recently, maybe with the ongoing exec().

 I guess it doesn't harm to review the allocator code... and add Michael to
 the CC. :-) Pity that I didn't have the allocator tracing enabled.
