Comment:

 Replying to [comment:3 axeld]:
 &gt; Replying to [comment:2 bonefish]:
 &gt; &gt; I'm having the suspicion that the page wasn't mapped twice after all,
 but that the kernel allocator did indeed hand out the chunk of memory more
 than once. It probably even kept doing that. That would perfectly explain
 that memory contents: First the hash table gets the chunk, clears it and
 repopulates the table. Later another large allocation gets the same chunk
 and causes the table to be 0xcc'd again. Later an environment array is
 copied from userland during an exec() call, each string being copied over
 the previous one.
 &gt;
 &gt; Not sure if that really fits so well: if the allocator would have done
 that, it would have overwritten the memory with 0xcc again.
 &gt; Another possibility would be that the page was copied into that region.

 Sure, I wouldn't rule that out. BTW it's very interesting to have a look
 at user_copy_strings_array() (team.cpp). It malloc()s a temporary buffer
 for the environment strings it copies from userland, which would result in
 exactly the memory pattern seen on that page. Even more interestingly the
 buffer size is 4 * B_PAGE_SIZE, while the size allocated for the hash
 table array is 4 * 4093. Both are &quot;large&quot; allocations, i.e. greater than
 the maximal allocator bin size.

 I've reviewed the large allocation code and it looks good, save for the
 allocation ID stuff. heap_next_alloc_id() gives out IDs limited to
 interval [0, 511]. So, if enough large allocations are made, it is
 possible that two allocations with the same ID are assigned adjacent page
 ranges. If the first one is freed, the pages of the second one are freed
 as well and will thus be reused although still being in use. Which could
 definitely cause this problem.

 I don't see why heap_next_alloc_id() limits the IDs like that in the first
 place, but even if it used the full 16 bits, that would just make the
 situation less likely. Instead I'd use consecutive numbers for the pages
 of an allocation (starting with 1). I'll do that.

 &gt; &gt; Yep, I noticed that. The hash table already contains 2622 entries,
 though, so the last rehashing was already almost 400 entries ago. Since
 the table contains complete garbage only, I'd suspect that the trouble
 started only recently, maybe with the ongoing exec().
 &gt;
 &gt; Have you had a look at the pages around that one? Maybe it's not the
 only one with such contents?

 The attachment also shows the last bytes of the previous (0x00) and
 several bytes of the next page (0xcc).
