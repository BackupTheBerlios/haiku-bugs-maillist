Comment(by mmlr):

 Replying to [comment:15 oruizdorantes]:
 &gt; &gt; So it's like the first one is too long with useless data and the
 second one is too short?
 &gt;
 &gt; First is too long with usefull data(even complete packet) and 0's.
 &gt; Second one is again with useful data, but too short 2 bytes, missing 12
 more... I am able to say I miss 12 because, the incoming 2 bytes already
 contained information about the size.

 Yeah I guess the mixed up transfer length of the last packet would explain
 this totally.

 &gt; &gt; * The files need a _serious_ review concerning coding style
 &gt;
 &gt; Feel free to comment the most appearing ones. I guess this is the
 Identifier rule for functions and var names(underscores), But I expected
 it was ok in a C file.

 Take h2generic.c:
 272: No spaces after &quot;(&quot;.
 273: We don't indent like that, we only indent one tab, in this case
 though you'd indent two because of the sub-expression &quot;() pair&quot; you are
 in, the operators &quot;||/&amp;&amp;&quot; go on the next line.
 305: The only opening brace that opens on the next line is the one after
 the &quot;case:&quot; because this one has a different semantical meaning. All
 others go on the same line.
 307: 80 chars per line.
 344: Spaces after commas and operators.
 369: No braces for single line blocks (ifs, loops)
 370: I would avoid special characters in code (the upside down question
 mark isn't an ascii char).

 In general, variable names are supposed to be obvious, and camel cased. So
 &quot;ep&quot; -&gt; &quot;endPoint&quot;, &quot;new_bt_dev&quot; -&gt; &quot;newBTDevice&quot; and all such. They are
 even inconsistently named, some are camel cased, some not, some are
 abbreviated some aren't, you get the drift.

 &gt; &gt; * You may want to think about locking the device structures [...]
 &gt;
 &gt; Yep, this is in the TODO list once the number of threads in the
 playground is clear.

 Through the async callbacks the thread count already is &gt; 1, so locking
 already makes sense.

 &gt; &gt; Meaning that if there is a max packet size of 8 bytes this does by no
 means mean that you can or should only schedule 8 bytes at a time. The
 only thing it means is that if you schedule more bytes that those it will
 (internally) split these up into multiple USB packets.
 &gt;
 &gt; So would be fine to schedule the size just as the biggest packet I am
 expecting to receive?

 Yes that's exactly what you'd want to do.

 &gt; &gt; With that context, is it possible that the event you are receiving
 simply doesn't fit into that buffer?
 &gt;
 &gt; I remember those interrupt endpoints use to be 16, but I have been
 receiving completelly in one hook buffers of 256.
 &gt; So being honest never understood the size parameter in the queue call,
 as I could get bigger or smaller buffers.

 If you ever get bigger sizes than the buffers you handed in, this is a
 severe bug and must be reported. Because in that case random buffers would
 be overwritten, which must not happen.
