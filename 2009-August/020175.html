Comment(by mmlr):

 Replying to [comment:11 oruizdorantes]:
 &gt;&gt; What transfer length do you use when doing mentioned transfer?
 &gt; For that pipe the reported max_packet_size.

 I more meant in that concrete case, to see if the length reported had any
 relation to it.

 &gt; &gt;Just to verify that, could you try the same on a UHCI controller
 instead and see if it behaves differently?
 &gt;
 &gt; Hmm, I developed the stack with a similar device to that one
 BCM2035(product ID is different) in a UHCI, &amp; always size was a coherent
 value with valid data. But Monni could confirm that for his particular
 dongle.

 It'd really help to know, as I don't see anything obviously problematic
 when looking over it.

 &gt; My concern is not that I get 0's at end(driver &quot;could&quot; somehow discard
 it or realize is invalid), but after that buffer, next one comming valid,
 data but incomplete, therefore blocks the stack waiting for the remaining
 part. So maybe those 0's might give a clue...

 So it's like the first one is too long with useless data and the second
 one is too short? What lengths are we talking about, do they make any
 sense, like is the extra bytes matching what is missing on the second one
 or something similar?

 &gt; In ohter words, this incoming interrupt is a reply of a previous ongoing
 control transfer. But in a USB side would not matter, would it?
 (submit_tx_command() in same file)

 It doesn't matter, no. The USB stack has no knowledge of that, the pipes
 are completely independent.

 A few remarks about that driver:

 * The files need a _serious_ review concerning coding style

 * There is a synchronous submit_request() method you might want to use for
 sending commands. I don't know if it makes sense, just mentioning it in
 case you haven't seen it.

 * You may want to think about locking the device structures you are
 accessing from the completed hooks as you really never know when these are
 going to be called and when your other threads (from which you schedule
 the transfers) are preempted. Right now it looks like non-vital data, but
 always keep in mind that the thread where you schedule the transfer might
 be preempted right after scheduling, possibly leading to the hook being
 called before you return from your submit function. So you must always
 make sure that whatever the hook triggers is prepared for this situation.

 * In a similar note, everything you do from that hook will block all other
 USB transfers on the same controller, be they outgoing or incoming. It is
 therefore vital that the hooks are processed as quickly as possible. You
 could look at them like interrupt handlers. Therefore, if there is any
 heavy stuff going on you must employ a DPC to handle the work in a
 separate thread. Otherwise you will degrade performance and may trigger
 timeouts for other devices. Accordingly you must also never block in such
 a handler, or call functions that may block.
