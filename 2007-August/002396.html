Comment (by tangobravo):

 --Observed R5 behaviour--
 If mouse is moved over the view, the first message instantly begins
 processing. If the mouse is stopped before processing completes, only one
 more event is processed. This suggests all B_MOUSE_MOVED messages in the
 queue (excluding the one currently being processed) are removed before the
 new event is added to the end.
 It seems the BView::MouseDown and MouseUp functions also call MouseMoved -
 Haiku does this too. Perhaps this was so there are no issues with simply
 removing all B_MOUSE_MOVED messages.
 The KeyDown override was to examine the behaviour if it is not only mouse
 events that take a long time to process. I tested by pressing a key,
 moving the mouse, pressing a key, moving the mouse, etc. Interestingly
 some of the MouseMoved events did still get through before all the
 keypresses were processed, although many were removed. I had thought
 something like this might be needed to ensure that the view does receive
 *some* MouseMoved notifications, but I haven't discovered the exact scheme
 employed by R5.
 I also haven't examined how the B_ENTERED_VIEW etc flags are dealt with
 when using B_NO_POINTER_EVENTS.

 --Current Haiku Behaviour (r20572)--
 All the events are delivered to the view in the order in which they
 occurred.

 I assigned the bug to the app_server as it seemed the appropriate place to
 do any removal of old messages as it as the entity that should know about
 the EventMask set for the view.
