 I will attach my screensaver collection (115 items -2,4Mb) which i used
 for
 testing Haiku's ScreenSavers. Good news is that most of them (~100) seems
 to
 work, didn't test them in fullscreen mode though.
 Here are what i've found for the rest of them:

 *1. I've started ScreenSaver from Terminal and on every ssaver selection i
 got
  &quot;runtime_loader: cannot open file /boot/beos/system/add-ons/Screen
 Savers/&lt;screensaver_name&gt;&quot;.

 Tip: open ~/config/settings window to delete screensaver_settings file
 when
 ScreenSaver start to crash on start. I think this is something to work out
 too.

 *2. This screensavers will crash ScreenSaver pref:
 DS_Wobble:      Segment violation
 KanjiSaver:     Segment violation
 LicenseBreaker: Segment violation
 MeltdownBlur:   Trying to delete a view that belongs to a window.Call
 RemoveSelf
 first.
 PrimalVision:   Trying to delete a view that belongs to a window.Call
 RemoveSelf
 first.
 Roto_saver:     elf_resolve_symbol: could not resolve symbol
 SetiSaver:      Segment violation
 Sphere:         Segment violation
 ZeroWing:       addon_file ain't readable.  darn!
 ChaoticLine:    have some problems too, don't remember.
 Samhain:        will freeze ScreenSaver.
 MapSaver:       !!!Haiku will reboot!!!
 BrainWash:      !!!Haiku will became black&amp;white!!!
 IdleMind:       ScreenSaver will close.

 *3. Screensavers are wrongly sorted in the end of that list.
 *4. Almost all ssaver have font sensitive issues. (e.g. Nebula ;-) )
 *5. ScreenSaver itself isn't font sensetive.
 *6. Running almost every screensaver in fullscreen will not let you out.
 You
 have to switch to another workspace and kill screen_blanker. (test case:
 Nebula)
 *7. After you killed screen_blanker in #6 via team monitor switch to first
 workspace, team monitor will be behind ScreenSaver pref.
 *8. If you have this savers installed and delete ScreenSaver_settings,
 after
 ScreenSaver start it will not select 1st module, but 6th or 7th instead.
 *9. Module listview need to prettfy.

 All in all this is collection is a good stress tests for haiku, which
 should
 show it week sides.
 If there is a need, i could attach back traces for every crashing module.

Comment (by jackburton):

 Diver, can you recheck after r19891 ?
