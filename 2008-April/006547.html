  Priority:  normal       |   Milestone:  Unscheduled   
 Component:  - General    |     Version:  R1 development

Comment (by kaoutsis):

 Replying to [comment:7 axeld]:
 &gt; Now I see what you mean. The first &quot;detection&quot; process doesn't detect
 anything, it's the PCI bus manager that dumps all devices it knows.
 Furthermore, the kernel has no knowledge of what driver is supposed to
 handle which device.
 &gt;
 Exactly!
 a) the first &quot;detection&quot; process doesn't detect anything. Why not?
 b) the kernel has no knowledge of what driver is supposed to handle which
 device. Why not?
 Now let's forget for a moment the technical part (and the above example).
 Would it be nicer from a _logical_ point of view, the kernel to have a
 reliable
 discover mechanism, with the ability to query the actual hardware parts,
 and then
 load only the needed drivers?

 &gt; The new driver architecture is supposed to help with that issue - it
 will still be necessary to scan for older drivers, though, and those that
 aren't just PCI drivers.
 Ok. At least, i find i little annoying the fact that the kernel probing
 non-existing
 drivers, putting aside the time penalty to load and unload the driver(s).
 Of course, the central idea was (is) to make the kernel technically
 smarter,
 thus the ticket was for the 'enhancement' idea, there is no actual bug
 anywhere:-)
