publishing USB2 devices.
-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
 Reporter:  siarzhuk     |       Owner:  mmlr          
     Type:  bug          |      Status:  new           
 Priority:  normal       |   Milestone:  R1            
Component:  Drivers/USB  |     Version:  R1 development
 Platform:  All          |  
-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
 1) The laptop PC with following USB Controller was tested:

 V       8086    Intel Corporation
 D       2658    82801FB (ICH6) USB UHCI Controller 1
 D       2659    82801FB (ICH6) USB UHCI Controller 2
 D       265A    82801FB (ICH6) USB UHCI Controller 3
 D       265B    82801FB (ICH6) USB UHCI Controller 4
 D       265C    82801FB (ICH6) USB 2.0 EHCI Controller

 2) Tested system has &quot;Legacy USB Support&quot; settings in BIOS. There are two
 possible states for this option: Enabled and Disabled.


 3) Terminal command

 ls /dev/bus/usb/ -alR

 was used to check the fact of publishing device under corresponding
 directory in /dev hierarchy.

 4) Terminal command

 usb_dev_info /dev/bus/usb/N/M

 was used to obtain USB device information. The &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are
 corresponding subdirectory and file names of the device entry.

 5) Two syslog files attached to this bug report. First one was acquired
 with disabled BIOS Legacy USB Support option, second one was acquired with
 enabled option.

 6) Haiku revision used during this tests: 21181

 '''The Test I:'''

 Haiku was booted with _disabled_ BIOS &quot;Legacy USB support&quot;. Two USB2 mass
 storage devices were plugged in before the system boot.

 a)I use &quot;ls&quot; to check the device publishing and usb_dev_info to be sure
 that both mass storage device are published. All was OK.

 b) I have plugged one of devices out. Checked device entry with &quot;ls&quot; - it
 was still displayed, tried to obtain device information with
 &quot;usb_dev_info&quot; - it failed with &quot;cannot open&quot; message.

 c) I plugged this device in the _same_ port. Checked with &quot;ls&quot; - it is
 here. Checked with &quot;usb_dev_info&quot; - correct information displayed.

 d) Plugged this device out and plug it into _another_ port. Checked with
 &quot;ls&quot; - device entry not changed. Checked it with &quot;usb_dev_info&quot; - failed
 with &quot;cannot open&quot;. Tried to get &quot;usb_dev_info&quot; for other possible dev
 entries on this controller (from 0 to 7) - nothing found.


 '''The Test II'''

 Haiku was booted with _enabled_ BIOS &quot;Legacy USB support&quot;. One USB2 mass
 storage device with another USB1 mass storage device were plugged in
 before booting Haiku.

 a)I use &quot;ls&quot; to check the device publishing and usb_dev_info to be sure
 that both mass storage device are published. Only USB1 device was found.
 USB2 device was not published.

 b)I tried to plug USB2 device out and plug it into the same port. Nothing
 published under /dev. Tried to replug it into another port - nothing. Note
 that syslog contains corresponding &quot;pipe changed&quot; notifications for USB2
 device!

 c) The &quot;non-working plug in notifications&quot; issue from Test I is also
 observed with USB1 device in this test.


 '''The PROBLEM''':
 Looks like BIOS &quot;Legacy USB Support&quot; option has negative effect on Haiku&#180;s
 USB stack on tested system. In case this option is enabled - USB2 devices
 are not published in /dev hierarchy. Only USB1 are published.
 Unfortunately I have no possibility to check  this from real driver at
 this time - only &quot;ls&quot;-check was performed.

 '''NOTES''':
 Mentioned &quot;non-working plug in notify&quot; problem looks like not related to
 this BIOS &quot;legacy USB&quot; option. May be I should post it as another bug
 report?
