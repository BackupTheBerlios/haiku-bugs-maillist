Comment (by jonas.kirilla):

 There are many more inconsistencies, like how the filesystems are
 presented, how root / is unreachable from Tracker, /boot/var/tmp is hidden
 and /boot/home/Desktop is presented as your GUI root window (aka desktop)
 where also other things, like your mounted volumes, seem to be mounted,
 whereas they are in truth mounted at /something.

 There are many strange things in the CLI shell that most people without
 experience are likely to not understand at first. As expected. The CLI is
 there as a power tool for experienced users and of course for scripts and
 applications. It's not meant for casual or inexperienced users. Most
 people using Haiku should never have to use Terminal, but it needs to be
 there. The shell is part of the Haiku whole and can't easily be removed.
