Comment(by iFrodo):

 Replying to [comment:2 anevilyak]:
 &gt; There are two potential problems with this idea... one is that the apps
 can and do override the Zoom behavior (most apps don't actually maximize
 as BeOS tends to follow the more mac-style zoom convention which is to say
 resize window to fit content), which means this wouldn't be globally
 applicable, and

 Maybe not. But as you talk about Mac OS X... Mac OS X does have this
 feature. Indeed developer can override the zoom behavior, but if the Dock
 is visible without the auto hide option activated, whatever the developer
 did in it's zoom implementation, if the window was not already moved over
 the Dock before the zoom action, it will not go over the Dock when the
 Zoom button is pressed, it stops where the dock starts.

 So even in a Mac like way of handling window zoom, Apple (and I ;) )
 seem(s) to think it's not such a bad idea to not zoom over the Dock.
 Hopefully you can override it by first moving the window over the Dock,
 then zooming it, but it's a bit non intuitive. Or of course you can choose
 to auto hide the Dock, but if you don't like having the Dock auto hidden
 and don't like the maximize don't go over the Dock behavior, you have the
 only option do do the previously described gymnastic/

 So I don't like very much the OS X implementation, as you can't disable it
 entirely if you don't like it. That's why I suggest this behavior just as
 an option.

 &gt; 2) in any of the deskbar configurations that are not flat across the top
 or bottom, avoiding the deskbar would entail wasting a large amount of
 screen real estate since you can't do a non-rectangular window shape, and
 as such either the entire vertical or horizontal space (depending on how
 the limit is done) where deskbar resides would be off limits.


 Indeed, and that's also why I suggested it as an option. Personally I
 don't mind having that space &quot;wasted&quot;, like shown and the provided
 screenshot, I use the Deskbar on the right, so it use a non negligeable
 space. But I prefer a lot apps to have apps windows not going over it,
 even with that space &quot;wasted&quot;.

 And as it'd be an option, people who don't like it, can simply disable it
 (and it can be disabled by default).

 Basically, I agree with your point of view, and that's why I proposed it
 as an option. Making it a default non deactivable behavior would be a huge
 mistake indeed. It has to be an option to be a valid.
