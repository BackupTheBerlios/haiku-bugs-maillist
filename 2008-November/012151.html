Comment(by bonefish):

 To stop the speculations: gdb can only be attached to a team, and that's
 what the debug server does. When handing over the debugged team all
 threads that already caused a debug event (and are waiting for
 instructions from the debugger) will resend the notification messages to
 the new debugger. gdb will simply focus on the thread from which it gets
 the first message. The main problem is that gdb also enables other debug
 events, and that another thread could cause such a debug event quickly
 enough, sending its notification message earlier than any other thread,
 thus resulting in the input loop to be set to that thread instead of the
 &quot;bad&quot; one. Most likely this will be the main thread, since gdb also does a
 debug_thread() on this one (gdb doesn't know the debugged team has been
 handed over from the debug server, so it has to do that), but it could
 also be another thread that just received a signal, created a thread,
 loaded an add-on, etc.

 Anyway while this is certainly annoying, there's also no need to guess the
 thread in question. A &quot;cont&quot; should usually switch to the right one, and
 in doubt a look into the syslog will bring certainty. The debug server
 logs which thread was the cause and also dumps a stack trace.
