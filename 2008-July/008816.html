Comment:

 I think I understand the core of the problem, now. One issue is, as
 already mentioned, that jam uses a lot of heap (checking closer to the end
 of the build process it was about 270 MB) and when fork()ing twice that
 amount is reserved due to missing swap support.(*)

 The second problem is, that the block cache unnecessarily binds reserved
 memory in unused blocks. It doesn't free blocks until the low memory state
 is at least B_LOW_MEMORY_NOTE, which happens when only 2048 free pages are
 left. There are several issues. First of all the reserved memory and free
 pages aren't directly related. The available memory is just the lower
 boundary for pages that are either free or only used in caches (i.e. can
 be freed at any time). If for instance only 10 MB available memory are
 left although there are more than 2048 free pages, we won't be in any low
 memory state. fork()ing jam at that point will fail, since additional 270
 MB would need to be reserved. At the same time hundreds of MB could be
 bound in unused blocks.

 Possible changes to improve the situation:
  - Low memory states might also need to be triggered by low amount of
 available memory.
  - The block cache needs to indicate somehow how much memory it could
 free, if necessary.
  - vm_try_reserve_memory() might need to trigger freeing of memory and
 wait.

 There might also be other problems. When checking the caches situation in
 roughly the middle of a &quot;jam @image&quot; the kernel heap consisted of a 16 MB
 area and 11 additional 4 MB areas. This sounds like quite a bit more than
 it should be. Not sure to what degree this is indirectly caused by the
 massive caching that happens (i.e. allocations for cache structures, vnode
 structures, page mappings). Will examine this some more.


 (*) ATM there's a bug (already fixed in my branch) that after the first
 fork() + exec() there's no memory reserved for jam's heap itself. Whenever
 the heap is resized (which should happen quite a few times during the
 build process) that is remedied though, and the subsequent fork() will
 indeed cause twice the heap size to be reserved.
