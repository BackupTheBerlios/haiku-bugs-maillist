Comment:

 Replying to [comment:3 anevilyak]:
 &gt; For reference, I tried a few more builds and managed to panic the same
 way every time...

 Cool, we tried a few times, but never could -- respectively ran into other
 problems.

 &gt; is there any extra information I can gather from the kernel debugger
 that'd be helpful?

 Yep, in vm.cpp make fault_get_page() and fault_find_page() non-inline (and
 maybe non-static), so that they aren't inlined into vm_soft_fault(). When
 you reproduce it next time the function offset in the stack trace function
 where the kernel page fault occurs would be important to know (should be
 in one of these three functions -- don't mind the rest of the stack
 trace). Please add an objdump of that function to the ticket (best get
 that on the build platform). That should provide us with the exact
 location in the source where things go wrong. It pretty much depends on
 that, what to investigate in the kernel debugger. You can do some general
 looking around though: You can use the &quot;call&quot; command to get the
 vm_soft_fault() parameters and thus the user fault address and kind of
 fault (read/write). The address gets you the area in question, via the
 area you can use &quot;cache_tree&quot; and &quot;cache&quot; to have a look at the caches
 that might be involved -- something may or may not look suspicious.

 Normally mutex_lock/unlock() come in pairs. That the object pointer
 becomes NULL inbetween is certainly weird. Maybe it already helps to know
 the exact location where that happens and have a keen-eyed look at the
 source to turn the bug up.
