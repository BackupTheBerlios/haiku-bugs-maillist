Comment(by rudolfc):

 Hi there,

 I just tested some time on a image version from 15 or 16 januari 2009 on
 my Asus P5E3 mainboard. It seems the trouble is more or less the same.

 Description:
 The first stick plugin, if booted from HD fails (new, was OK some time
 ago)
 The second plugin recognizes the stick and it pops up in the mount
 submenu.
 Writing a complete folder (apps in this case) seems to work if you look at
 the progress bar, but at about 70% or so it comes to a temporary
 standstill. It will go-on or resume a bit later but at visibly lower
 speed.

 Reading back the folder (I am constantly misled by the move instead of
 copy default action in tracker) apparantly succeeds, but is very slow:
 comparable to the last writing actions.

 Once tracker says its finished (progress bar disappears from screen) I
 cannot unmount the stick. Apparantly it's still in use. If I wait 5
 minutes (or was it more?) then I can unmount the stick according to
 tracker's behaviour though it does not normally succeed. Tracker becomes
 less responsive, the mount submenu is dead if I remember correctly.
 Shutdown works today. So I was able to add some parts of the syslog to
 this bugreport.

 In the time between the readback 'completed' (progress bar disappeared)
 and my 'successfull' unmount stick action I was able to mount another HD
 partition, write some files, and unmount it again.
 After the stick unmount this is nolonger possible.

 I have added one file from another 'test' today in which more or less the
 same behaviour applied. There was one extra strange thing (I did not see
 before BTW): the stick dissapeared from screen (unmounted) completely on
 it's own (while having a folder open of the stick). I did not issue an
 unmount command.

 The behaviour of having a terminal window open has influence on the
 stick's behaviour I could not reproduce, seems that's OK these days.

 ---

 A note about my mainboard: in the BIOS there's an option for ownership
 handoff I believe as well as an entry for legacy support. If I enable
 legacy support (needed for a boot from stick) Haiku is not successfull in
 aquiring ownership of the USB hardware even though I specified in the BIOS
 it should hand it off.

 If I disable legacy support in the BIOS Haiku successfully claims
 ownership. The  boot is faster on the 4th icon in this case (timeout
 trying to claim ownership I take it).

 I just mention it for completeness sake, one can never know if this could
 be a hint of some sort.

 Bye!

 Rudolf.
