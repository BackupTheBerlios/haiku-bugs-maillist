Old description:

&gt;<i> If you don't have a folder with many files (like 30000+), you can
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce it by running a query for all files (Alt-F + Enter). I have at
</I>&gt;<i> least over 58000 files on both partitions and I am still watching the
</I>&gt;<i> files dripple into the list as of now. The first couple thousands will go
</I>&gt;<i> in quickly enough, although it could be argued it should be faster. But
</I>&gt;<i> after 20000 files, it becomes apparent that something somewhere doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> scale very well, and I am strongly guessing that it's the list insertion
</I>&gt;<i> in Tracker. The sorting to find the right index is probably binary search
</I>&gt;<i> based and fast enough, but then I suppose (without having looked at the
</I>&gt;<i> code), that it updates the vertical position of all the following items.
</I>&gt;<i> If that's indeed what's happening, one could also mark the position as
</I>&gt;<i> invalid until encountering the first item with an invalid position (which
</I>&gt;<i> would result in items with invalid positions starting at some index until
</I>&gt;<i> the last item). The correct position could then be retrieved once it's
</I>&gt;<i> needed (when drawing). Maybe there is even more room for optimization in
</I>&gt;<i> the code. (Now my list contains 66500 entries and the harddrive LED is
</I>&gt;<i> barely flashing with lots of CPU usage inbetween.)

New description:

 It looks to me like a paranoid check, but maybe it prevents a corner case
 because of some stuff happening asynchronously. I can't really tell. Maybe
 turn it into an assert which is not compiled in in release mode?

Comment(by stippi):

 Replying to [comment:13 aldeck]:
 &gt; For reference, the AddMimeType issue has been fixed in r28891 .
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Now i'd like to address the 'FindPose' issue, see this check before each
 Pose creation:
 &gt;
 &gt; line 1610 in PoseView.cpp :
 &gt; {{{
 &gt; if (FindPose(model) || FindZombie(model-&gt;NodeRef())) {
 &gt;                       // we already have this pose, don't add it
 &gt;                       watch_node(model-&gt;NodeRef(), B_STOP_WATCHING,
 this);
 &gt;                       delete model;
 &gt;                       if (resultingPoses)
 &gt;                               resultingPoses[modelIndex] = NULL;
 &gt;                       continue;
 &gt;               }
 &gt; }}}
 &gt;
 &gt; The FindPose search being o(n) this hurts performance a lot. Searching
 the ZombieList should be ok as it should be quite small if not empty most
 of the time.
 &gt;
 &gt; Now i've reviewed a lot the code and i can't imagine a case where a
 Model could be added two times... I added debug output here and it never
 happens with my tests. Was this a mistake or a paranoid check? Ideas
 welcomed :)
