Comment(by stippi):

 Replying to [comment:9 rudolfc]:
 &gt; If I think about what Stephan said I'd say this drift-averaging makes
 audio more robust indeed. Don't know what effect it has if you use a
 mediaplayer with variable playback speed though: will it respond less
 promptly on settings changes for instance?
 &gt; I'd say some sort of optimum/compromise would have to be found, but
 improvement over the current default multi-media-addon is certainly
 possible.

 No, the drift averaging will have no effect whatsoever on the latency.
 It's really just a way to get a smoother change in drift. Drift in audio
 happens when the true clock frequency of the audio hardware is slightly
 different from what it's supposed to be. Like 48005 Hz instead of 48000
 Hz. It is not uncommon. The Media Kit can compensate this by sending
 buffers at a slightly faster or slower rate, it could even to have audio
 playback at the correct speed anyways, but I am not a fan of that, since
 it degrades quality, no matter how good the resampler. I'd rather have a
 song be 0.5 seconds shorter or faster. You calculate the drift in the
 Media Kit node by comparing the expected buffer duration (performance
 time) with the measured buffer duration (OS real time clock). Usually, the
 node will wait on an interrupt of the hardware (ie a semaphore released by
 the driver), and since it runs at realtime priority, it should wake up as
 soon as possible when the driver releases the semaphore. This *seems* to
 be where Haiku currently still has some problems. But obviously one effect
 of that is less accurate drift calculation, since the measurement of the
 realtime between two buffers, respectively two semaphore wake ups, is less
 accurate. The averaging should be useful even if the wakeup latency would
 be much better on Haiku, since it will never be perfect. And as I already
 explained, it was necessary on ZETA as well (tested with C-Media
 hardware). In any case, the latency for userland applications is totally
 uneffected by all this.
