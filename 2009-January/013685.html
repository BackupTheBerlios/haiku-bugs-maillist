Comment(by Adek336):

 With net_route_infos, to use the route, one has to read
 net_route_info::route, and then increase it's reference count. But the
 route may be destroyed in between! Clearly a function to do it atomically
 is needed. There also seem to be no users of net_route_info atm :-))

 Apart from locking, there might be a problem with deleting a default route
 and setting up a new one. The current code would put the route and try to
 setup a new one. However, only one default route may exist, so if the
 action of removing the old route was delayed (because, for example, some
 small helper function like ipv4_get_mtu got the route and it's thread lost
 the cpu before putting the route) then the new route won't be set up. Also
 the old route is going to be removed shortly, so no default routes remain!

 One solution is to drop the route from the route list when removing the
 route. That lets the new route be created and the old route used. If also
 everybody except the small helper functions use net_route_info than they
 would soon update and put the old route.

 Another solution is, when servicing SIOCDELR, to block servicing SIOCDELR
 until everyone puts the old route. Again, this requires that everybody use
 net_route_info and if net_timer would want to remove the route, it might
 deadlock (but I think only user apps would ever want to remove routes and
 that net_timer doesn't try to remove routes).

 As for why the page fault happens: when net_server tries to reconfigure
 the default route, the stack puts the route to tell the world that it no
 longer references it, that it gives up it's ownership of the route. The
 route still has a positive reference count due to TCP endpoints, so it is
 not really removed and the new default route isn't installed when another
 default route exists. Soon net_server wants to reconfigure the default
 route and the stack puts the route again... so it gives up ownership of a
 route whom it does not possess ! Possibly net_route_private could remember
 how many times it was supposed to be removed so that remove_route would
 panic or return error on second and later tries.
