Comment(by Pete):

 [Augghh!! I just spent half an hour composing an entry, but added a couple
 of attachments before I previewed it -- and lost it all!!  I will try to
 recreate it....]

 After a few more days of hell [and a pleasant interlude or two -- like a
 weekend of music in Golden Gate Park (:-)]  I think I have the page fault
 problem licked.

 As far as I can tell, the faults seem to have been caused by the driver
 and its objects going away before the system was finished accessing them.
 The crash was never in the actual usb_midi code at all.  A fragment of
 serial output and stack trace is attached that shows something of what was
 happening.  In this case it seems that legacy_drivers::UninitDevice was
 trying to reach now-absent data.

 To prevent this, I've moved object deletion as late as possible.  The
 device removal itself is now in usb_midi_free.  Even this was apparently
 not enough if too many dprintf statements were also enabled, so I think
 there must still be a hazard somewhere.  (Part of the reason I was having
 so much trouble tracking things down.)  With printout suppressed, though,
 it seems to be stable.

 The slightly unfortunate result (at least I think it's a result -- the
 crashes were preventing me seeing exactly what was happening before) is
 that each time one unplugs and replugs the usb cable, a new device is
 created in /dev/midi/usb.  Originally /dev/midi/usb/0, it becomes
 /dev/midi/usb/1, and so on.  The device nodes don't accumulate, but each
 is not deleted until the cable is plugged in again, and of course they
 become safely inactive when it's unplugged.  I think this is because
 publish_devices is not invoked when the device is finally removed; when it
 is called in response to a new device things get corrected.

 I think I can live with this, but the user will need to be aware of the
 need to adjust things if they replug the cable.

 I've attached a zip of the sources (not a diff) that have changed (since
 r33202).
