Comment(by mmlr):

 Replying to [comment:22 rudolfc]:
 &gt; Well, mmlr, using capitals to kindly inform me of something does give me
 a bit off pissed off feeling after all. Wouldn't that do the same for you?

 It was intended to make more obvious what was more subtle in the other two
 comments I added: That I know where the problem is and am actively working
 on resolving it, so adding workarounds is not well spent effort. Since you
 didn't seem to acknowledge that I tried to be more blunt about it. Of
 course I can't restrict you in what you invest your time in, but I find it
 sad to see someone going into a direction that in the long run doesn't pay
 off. I usually like to be told before spending efforts. And since you
 wrote that you are just about to implement the write cache as well as
 wanted to invest time into further benchmarking I saw the chance of still
 saving you from a bit more time that wouldn't go into the final direction.

 &gt; Anyhow. I'm a practical kind of guy. Until you prove that what you say
 works (because it's implemented), I am going forward with this workaround
 as you call it, if only for my personal version of Haiku.

 I'm sorry, but I do also have a bit of knowledge in this field and I
 guarantee you that what I am saying is actually the case. Why do I know
 this for sure? Because before the introduction of the IO scheduler and
 related functionality this issue was not present, because you can easily
 test if there is a general problem with USB performance or not (which it
 isn't), and because I already have analyzed and tracked down the exact
 place the problem is. DoIO::IO() in vfs_request_io.cpp for reading and how
 writing is done in vm_page.cpp for writing.

 &gt; Tell me, why did you create the usb_disk driver while that's a
 workaround? The thing to do is complete the SCSI to USB connection
 instead. Still you did this workaround.

 Because the two things are on a completely different scale. The usb_disk
 driver is a workaround, yes, but the usb_scsi part needs quite a lot of
 rework to get integrated properly. Just compare the LOC of both and you
 see that it wasn't exactly a huge task to implement usb_disk. Also the
 intention of usb_disk was to provide only a very limited set of actual
 SCSI, since many devices aren't strictly SCSI and actually have issues
 when attached to an actual SCSI stack because they don't handle a lot of
 commands. Taking a look at the quirks lists in other OSes you can easily
 see that it might be simpler to attach a simplified driver with a limited
 known good SCSI command set. That's what usb_disk is.

 And indeed usb_scsi would run into the exactly same problem in this case
 simply because there is no physical memory API in the USB stack yet.

 &gt; I asked you some questions, will you answer them for me? I'd like to get
 educated here. Oh, and please don't dismiss my hardware knowledge too
 soon. You just _might_ overlook something...

 I certainly don't dismiss your hardware knowledge, but please also
 acknowledge that I have a very deep understanding of these parts of Haiku
 since I've worked on most levels already and am kind of familiar with the
 USB implementation since I've plain simply wrote most of it. If I wasn't
 sure as to where the reasons are then I'd certainly be open to these
 efforts, but as I said the issue is understood.

 To your questions: Why 4K? -&gt; That's B_PAGE_SIZE, yes Why 2K block
 reads/writes? -&gt; Because that's depending on a few factors, mostly FS
 block size as well as device block size influence it. When BFS inodes are
 read for example they will be 2K on default settings. If actual file
 content is read/written the blocks will be 4K.

 Plans: Short term: change the mapping strategy, which brings back the read
 speeds to acceptable values (already done) and investigate the best
 solution on implementing burst write backs of pages to get normal write
 speeds. Right now all writing (except for directly accessing a device
 through dd for example) is chopped up into B_PAGE_SIZE transfers. This is
 simply because of how page write backs work right now and is mostly hidden
 by the caches and by the low latency on harddisks in normal use cases. On
 a USB stick you will clearly notice it though, especially if you're
 waiting for the sync or unmount to complete when you want to finally
 unplug the device.

 Long term: Implement a physical memory API for the USB stack, possibly
 migrating it to use IORequests right away. This can only work for EHCI
 however and means a lot of work in general, so this won't be ready too
 soon. Then usb_scsi can be revisited and be properly integrated. As
 mentioned above though, it has a lot of features and therefore a higher
 chance of provoking device issues compared to the limited SCSI implemented
 in usb_disk, so this has to be very carefully planned and tested to ensure
 compatibility. Note also that the protocols besides transparent SCSI
 aren't really relevant anymore, as current devices almost never use
 anything else (this is thanks to Microsoft which discourages anything else
 than transparent SCSI, which I agree with because it makes things a lot
 simpler and more standardized).

 Let's move to #4690 for further discussion, as the original issue here has
 been fixed and #4690 is specifically about the performance (there was
 another one, but I can't seem to find it right now).
