Comment(by mmlr):

 Replying to [comment:35 Pete]:
 &gt; To prevent this, I've moved object deletion as late as possible.  The
 device removal itself is now in usb_midi_free.  Even this was apparently
 not enough if too many dprintf statements were also enabled, so I think
 there must still be a hazard somewhere.  (Part of the reason I was having
 so much trouble tracking things down.)  With printout suppressed, though,
 it seems to be stable.

 The free hook is supposed to be called only after all open handles have
 been close()d and all other calls like read/write/ioctl have completed. So
 if there is still an open count in the free hook or access to the device
 after the free hook returned that'd be a bug in the devfs code for legacy
 drivers.

 &gt; I think this is because publish_devices is not invoked when the device
 is finally removed; when it is called in response to a new device things
 get corrected.

 Any add/remove of a device that matches the support descriptors of your
 driver will also cause a rescan of the driver to happen. It should in that
 case call publish_devices also after the unplug. That requires that you
 have the list updated before returning from the device_removed hook you
 provide. Again, if this doesn't work there might be a bug in the devfs
 code.

 &gt; I think I can live with this, but the user will need to be aware of the
 need to adjust things if they replug the cable.

 Um, they are bugs, so living with them isn't really the way to go ;-)

 &gt; I've attached a zip of the sources (not a diff) that have changed (since
 r33202).

 It's generally easier if you avoid attaching zips. That is because the
 zips can't be viewed inline in the bug tracker.
