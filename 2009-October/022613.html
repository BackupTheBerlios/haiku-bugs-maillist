Comment(by mmlr):

 Hi Rudolf

 &gt; It was the way you wrote that and the just partly response I got that
 triggered me this way.

 Understandable, sorry for that again.

 &gt; Well, I still have my original feeling: there is not one problem, but
 two. (Of course, that can just be my own stupidity in not recognizing
 something, but I want to understand the reason anyhow.) Because, if I run
 dd in windows, on 4kb blocks, I get 8Mb/sec reading speed. If stuff
 performed reasonably well on Haiku, with 4kB blocks because of
 B_PAGE_SIZE, I would expect not 8MB read speed, but also not 1Mb read
 speed. say 3-5Mb would be reasonably well performance in my eyes.

 I'm not sure if the dd on Windows will actually directly access the device
 with that block size. If it writes into a cache then that'd skew the
 numbers.

 &gt; BTW With dd in Haiku, using 4kb blocks, I get the same read and write
 speed as if I were just plain copying files using Tracker.

 Yes, that verifies the fact that either transfer ends up using 4K blocks,
 even though Tracker uses a far larger block size.

 &gt; About cache in general: I don't agree per se that you are correct that
 there should only be one cache. Looking at PC hardware there are more than
 one as well. I am convinced they exist only because it makes sense to have
 them. (level1, 2, and 3 cache between CPU en memory, another is MTRR-WC
 I'd say).

 Well, those caches do all have different purposes, where level one is near
 and fast, level two is shared across cores but still nearer than RAM and
 so forth. The cache we are talking about is only file and block caches and
 always resides in RAM. There should only be one single representation of a
 file in memory. All reads and writes to or from should then be mere
 &quot;pointers&quot; to that memory with a corresponding base address and length to
 describe the section. This is exactly what iovecs do and how the
 IORequests work. In the end, there is a single cache to hold the data and
 populating it and writing it back is done on this set of physical pages
 through the use of optimized IORequests (holding optimized iovecs) that
 describe the wanted sections with the least possible descriptors. Then all
 layers operate on these requests, adjusting offsets and lengths only
 instead of copying stuff. That's pretty much how the IO path already works
 for disks right now. The requests aren't yet fully optimized, i.e. they
 aren't combined at some places where they could be. But file reads for
 example are described using IORequests, the filesystem provides vectors to
 map the scattered file to partition offsets, the devfs then adjusts
 offsets to compensate for partition to disk offsets. All this happens
 without any data copying, so in the end the disk driver directly DMA reads
 into the physical pages provided for the cache. That's as good as it can
 get and is the long term goal for USB as well.

 &gt; So I am not that convinced yet that in the end you will not end up using
 some sort of a second cache on the lower levels to deal with the quirks of
 hardware (to minimize bottlenecks specific to certain kind of hardware).

 The upper layers should always provide the longest contiguous
 buffers/vectors. The drivers down the IO path can then chop that up as
 needed to accommodate for the different hardware. While flash media is
 certainly an extreme example, the general rule of long burst reads/writes
 being faster than small transfers holds true for pretty much all other
 storage as well. Due to the latency differences you just notice it more on
 some hardware.

 &gt; Well, I suggest to forget about my tests now since it seems from your
 words you got it all fully under control.

 Feel free to continue with testing, just be sure to wait for the imminent
 changes to happen first. Before these are in, pretty much all benchmark
 results will simply show that it sucks and all the numbers are invalidated
 as soon as a change happens.

 &gt; For instance you already mentioned 'change the mapping strategy'. Which
 revision should I look at for playing with that?

 That'd be r33503 from just a few minutes ago. It should bring read speeds,
 while yet not fully optimized, to acceptable levels. As mentioned, the
 write side is a bit more involved, but I'm working on integrating those
 changes as well.
