 &gt; Replying to [comment:35 Pete]:
 &gt; The free hook is supposed to be called only after all open handles have
 been close()d and all other calls like read/write/ioctl have completed. So
 if there is still an open count in the free hook or access to the device
 after the free hook returned that'd be a bug in the devfs code for legacy
 drivers.

 I'm afraid I got fairly confused trying to track the order of occurrences,
 especially as the dprintfs often seemed to ''cause'' the page faults.  I'm
 checking the open count in the free hook (as well as checking the active
 flag) and with printouts enabled these seemed to be correct.

 I'm not sure how to dig deeper.  I tried to recompile just the kernel
 (from the slightly older sources I currently have) with some dprintfs in
 legacy_drivers.cpp, but I got a (repeating!) page fault at boot.  I assume
 I should be able to do that if everything matches (?) so I'll try again
 when I get the alpha release and matching sources installed.

 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I think this is because publish_devices is not invoked when the device
 is finally removed; when it is called in response to a new device things
 get corrected.
 &gt;
 &gt; Any add/remove of a device that matches the support descriptors of your
 driver will also cause a rescan of the driver to happen. It should in that
 case call publish_devices also after the unplug. That requires that you
 have the list updated before returning from the device_removed hook you
 provide. Again, if this doesn't work there might be a bug in the devfs
 code.
 Again, I'm not sure of the exact sequence, or what actually triggers the
 call to publish_devices.  And I'm not sure what you mean by the
 'device_removed hook' -- I don't find that in the set of hooks.  There's a
 'close', a 'free', and an 'uninit_driver'.

 'remove_device_info' (in devlist.c) gets called (now) in 'usb_midi_close',
 and adjusts the driver's own list of names (ready to be published), but
 doesn't trigger any external action.  Then 'remove_device' gets called in
 'usb_midi_free'.  So it does rather sound to me as if 'publish_devices is
 not getting invoked when it should be.

 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I think I can live with this, but the user will need to be aware of
 the need to adjust things if they replug the cable.
 &gt;
 &gt; Um, they are bugs, so living with them isn't really the way to go ;-)
 Well, I suppose... (:-)) but I just checked, and Linux does pretty much
 the same thing -- except that the device ''does'' disappear when
 unplugged.  Here's what I got:

 {{{
 [Plug in the USB MIDI cable:]
 <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-bugs">pete at Lys</A>:~$ ls /dev/usbdev*
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.2_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.4_ep00
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.4_ep04
 /dev/usbdev1.2_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.4_ep86
 [Unplug it...:]
 <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-bugs">pete at Lys</A>:~$ ls /dev/usbdev*
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.2_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep00
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.2_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep81
 <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-bugs">pete at Lys</A>:~$ ls /dev/usbdev*
 [and plug it in again...:]
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.2_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.6_ep00
 /dev/usbdev1.1_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.6_ep04
 /dev/usbdev1.2_ep00  /dev/usbdev1.3_ep81  /dev/usbdev1.6_ep86
 }}}
 The other difference is that alsa itself manages to keep the same 'client
 number', and also lets you address the device by name.


 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I've attached a zip of the sources (not a diff) that have changed
 (since r33202).
 &gt;
 &gt; It's generally easier if you avoid attaching zips. That is because the
 zips can't be viewed inline in the bug tracker.
 Ah.  OK, sorry.  (I was really intending it for Philippe's use, thinking
 it might be easier for him to grab and look at.)  I'll attach the source
 of usb_midi.c, as I think that's the only one that's been affecting the
 crash.
