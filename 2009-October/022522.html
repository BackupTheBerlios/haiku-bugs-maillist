Comment(by rudolfc):

 Hi there mmlr,

 Thanks for the pointers you gave me. I've been testing a lot since that
 previous message of yours (I'll post benchmark details later) and I've got
 a few remarks/questions.
 I hope you will answer them. I'll just post it here, if you think we
 should continue this topic elsewhere please let me know.

 So, I have been tweaking with the usb_disk driver. From the looks of it,
 you are right: reading mostly takes place at 4k chuncks per read (although
 on a few occasions 8kb happens as well).

 I am guessing 4kb is used because that's equvalent to Be's page size.
 Correct?

 So: question, why is writing taking place at only 2kb chunks instead of
 4kb chuncks? This unnessesarily takes down speed.. Is this  a fault? if so
 I'd love to see that fixed.

 Question 2:  while reading, I see a lot of sequential reading takes place.
 That is, sequential chunks are read from the disk, although they might be
 placed on non-sequental adresses in (virtual) memory.

 Why is writing taking place in reversed sequential order? I am guessing
 this happens on for instance writing to the syslog, while writing a new
 file (so copying a file) does take place in normal sequential order. Is
 this correct?
 Couldn't the logfiles be written in sequential order as well? (I'd love
 that :)


 So, why am I asking?
 Well, I just implemented a simple caching piece of code inside the
 usb_disk driver that dramatically speeds up I/O.

 I tested on two systems, using some 5 different sticks, using cachesizes
 of:
 none, 16kb, 32kb, 64kb and 128kb.

 The sticks varied from 1Gb to 16Gb sticks, both slow types (write in
 windows @ 2,5Mb/sec, read @ 6Mb/sec) to fast types (write @ 22Mb/sec, read
 @ 32Mb/sec).

 I found that using 16Kb cache is a nice setting as a compromize between
 loading small scattered files to large sequential files.

 Using 16kB cache made the reading speed go from 0.93Mb/sec on seq. files,
 to 3.3Mb/sec. I have to note here that the kernel's caching system
 considerably slows down disk access (I think that's the interfering
 component, will check later).

 For instance, using 128kB cache gives me a read speed (seq. files) of
 around 20Mb/sec  at the start of a file copy for a second or so (for
 instance during 35Mb of a 160Mb file), then speed drops to around 5Mb/sec.
 (The 3.3Mb/sec mentioned above is with the slowdown, before it will be
 above 6Mb or so).

 Hmm, come to think of it, maybe the system cache does speedup things, but
 after the 35Mb it's full and can't place data quicky enough on the HD, I
 saw that HD copy is slow as well on haiku: around 6-7Mb/sec (half for
 reading, half for writing if copy takes place inside one HD).

 Oh, I have bootspeed figures as well (booting on stick, all types):
 with 16Mb cache I found the optimum booting speed, being some 15-20
 seconds shorter on all systems. using 128Mb slows down speed with say 15
 secs.

 I have to note here the cache I did only caches sequential reads.
 I don't have writing speed info yet, I'm implementing the same cache
 technique in the driver atm to see what that does.
 I can tell you I can work very nice already with haiku booted from stick
 now, even playback fullHD movies (that was unthinkable before..). The only
 stuttering I see is when a write access to the stick takes place. This can
 be made to be better when caching, though very small non sequential
 chuncks will always remain slow as long as the internal technique of USB
 sticks don't improve.

 Oh, I also plan to do some testing/benchmarking on a real USB HD to see if
 that behaves likewise.

 -------

 mmlr, you did not tell me yet what the plans are to improve things, or
 which ticket describes those plans? All info you have is interesting to
 me.. :-)

 Bye!

 Rudolf.
