Comment(by meianoite):

 Doh, sorry, sure it was &quot;ohci&quot; and not &quot;uhci&quot;. Changed the title of the
 ticket accordingly.

 Rebooting with ACPI disabled did nothing. Removing the &quot;ohci&quot; driver did
 allow the boot to continue without requiring me to hit the power button,
 though! But at the end of the boot I couldn't use neither keyboards nor
 mice, USB or PS/2.

 Another thing that doesn't work is a USB mouse that I have here.

 Really strange.

 Attached now are syslogs of booting without the &quot;ohci&quot; driver and booting
 back with the &quot;ohci&quot; driver in place and with the USB mouse attached, but
 unable to be used. Might shed a light on the cause of those issues. Of
 course, I'm still available for compiling with any debugging options you'd
 like me to.
