</I>&gt;<i>        As mentioned, if there are valid partitions defined in the MBR,

New description:

 Attached is a 512 byte PMBR boot loader that looks for the UUID of a Haiku
 GPT partition and boots it, falling back to MBR partitions if said UUID
 isn't found or if the (primary) GPT is corrupted or non-existent.

 Its usefulness is in being a generalised IPL that supports both
 partitioning styles, allowing it to be used transparently and even
 allowing disks to be converted from one partitioning style to the other
 with ease, should the need for more partitions or volumes over 2TiB arise
 (for instance when cloning an older disk to a newer, more capacious one).

 It also paves the way for Haiku to create and support booting from
 multiple volumes larger than 2TiB, which we're in the very privileged
 position of enjoying efficiently in the near future due to BFS. Another
 use case is taking a disk from a Intel EFI machine, plugging it on a BIOS
 machine and boot just fine; and vice-versa.

 As mentioned, if there are valid partitions defined in the MBR, and the
 primary GPT becomes corrupt, it can fall back to loading the MBR partition
 with the active flag set, if one is defined.

 Currently there's no provision for falling back to the GPT copy that lives
 in the end of the disk, due to the 512 bytes constraint; supporting this
 would require either some major refactoring of the code or disabling the
 support for booting from MBR using calls to int13h other than function
 4200h, &quot;LBA Read from Disk&quot;.

 It was tested on emulators and on my actual, proper computer. It can load
 Windows, Haiku and FreeBSD;  the number of sectors to load from the
 partition is adjustable, but beware that int13h 4200h only supports up to
 127 (0x7f) sectors, or a loader of almost 64KiB; so don't specify a larger
 number. This is not checked on the code, again because of space
 constraints.
