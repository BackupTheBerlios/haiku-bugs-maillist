Comment(by mmlr):

 It's not entirely surprising actually. It's not a problem of UHCI though,
 as you don't have UHCI controllers at all ;-) I think it's also not a
 problem in OHCI though. It cannot really do other than it does. What I'd
 find more likely is that it's because of ACPI enabling/expecting IO-APIC
 interrupt routing while we don't do that yet. In that case generating an
 interrupt (by hitting the power-button ACPI is signaled) it could unjam
 whatever loop it was in, waiting for interrupts. Does it work when you
 have ACPI disabled?
