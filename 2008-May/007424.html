Comment (by nutela):

 Thanks for the feedback.

 I think we can agree that having the name in the logo and having a clear-
 to-see menu entry are 2 different things. I agree that the name in the
 logo is purely a marketing thing except when used as a reference in a
 manual like &quot;like click the logo with the word Haiku next to it&quot;.

 Here are my thoughts about the clear-to-see menu entries.

 My problem with lots of menu's like these is that you can't tell which is
 the 'main' one, take KDE's bar or Gnome's bar, at work we have a few
 systems, Red Hat and Suse mainly, I frequently search for an application,
 settings and status -menu only to find it after I have clicked other
 symbols (I frequently launch a terminal or some other thing by clicking on
 the wrong widget) and then I think by myself [sarcasm on] &quot;Duh, so this
 tiny 16x16 little red thing (red hat) is the entry, well terrific!&quot;
 [sarcasm off] At least Suse used a tiny triangle (arrow) to discern
 between an regular shortcut icon and a menu. Suse version 10.x has got a
 nice &quot;start menu&quot; IMHO although the tabs are rather difficult to
 distinguish from the active one (it is still far better then XP's). It
 think it helps that the logo has a different size and aspect ratio the all
 other icons and widgets.
 MS's OTOH Start-logo maybe sounds dumb, it is pretty obvious. You can't
 get much more clear then that IMHO.

 The same applies for my cellphone's (Sony Ericson K750i) menu entry &quot;Menu&quot;

 So to conclude, this menu entry should &quot;stand out&quot;, glow or something
 similar when mouse is over it (if only if it would be the single thing
 which would do that in the entire OS) too show it is clickable, something
 more than the gazillion of functionality which is waiting to be discovered
 by the user.

 Of course it would be nice if the menu entry would be pretty as well, a
 blue leaf is a little bit illogical, I thought Haiku's theme was 3 leafs,
 red, green and yellow?
