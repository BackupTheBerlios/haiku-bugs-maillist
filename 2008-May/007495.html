Comment (by rudolfc):

 Hi again (Stephan :)

 I've placed the harddisk containing Haiku-OS in my other system (the 'old'
 P4-2800 533Mhz FSB Asus board). This system has a GeForce2ti (NV15) in it.
 It behaves the same: that is, the acceleration engine doesn't yield any
 results, nor does it crash.

 I've checked the syslog and saw Haiku OS is doing a number of things
 different (rather: extra) compared to R5/dano:
 - The EDID info block is fetched from the connected screen to determine
 the max (or native) resolution of this screen;
 - Haiku-OS switches to that mode using a VESA BIOS call (I guess). This is
 done before the switch takes place to protected mode (VESA 2.0 and 3.0
 both work correctly on my systems here).

 I've looked at the AGP busmanager messages: they are only there if the
 nvidia driver is in place: Hence the busmanager is only called by the gfx
 (kernel) driver as it should be (just like in R5/dano).

 All in all everything looks nice and dandy :-)
 I'm getting the real BeOS feeling here guys! Haiku works neat.. (just a
 few KDL's still). And it's a bit slow in drawing yet?

 OK, Because the VESA EDID and Setmode calls are not done on R5/dano I
 decided to test with 'multiple' (ok: 2) gfx cards in the P4 system.
 Primary BIOS card was a PCI G200 (Matrox) and the AGP NV15 was 'not used'.
 Using the nvidia driver I am telling R5 and Haiku to use this one for the
 desktop instead of the Matrox card.

 Looking at the syslog after a system boot/shutdown cycle I see Haiku
 fetching EDID and BIOS info from the MAtrox card. The spashscreen displays
 there and the resolution is switched OK.
 After the app_server starts up the nvidia card is initialized
 (coldstarted, using ananog VGA connection to screen). The Desktop comes up
 and the system is running OK.

 The acceleration engine is still down however. Conclusion, the BIOS calls
 are not the problem.

 So, I think I tested everything I could now (well, more or less), and the
 system behaves OK, just like the driver on R5/dano. On Haiku however the
 acceleration engine doesn't do it's thing.

 I think I'm looking at a compiler problem or something (I've seen it
 before with the 2D driver causing the 3D accelerant to nolonger function:
 it was a shared_info struct variable size compiler interpretation
 difference using different versions of the compiler.).
 Looks like I'll need to do a bughunt through shared_info once again. Or
 some other variable.
 Anyone any ideas or pointers for me maybe???

 I'll continue searching when I have time again, hopefully within a week or
 two max.

 Bye for now!

 Rudolf.
