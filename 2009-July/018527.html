Comment(by leavengood):

 Replying to [comment:3 axeld]:
 &gt;
 &gt; At least in this case, the Screenshot application doesn't really work
 like I would like it to work; it pretty much works like Ubuntu's
 screenshot app, though. I would find useful if the UI pops up only *after*
 the screenshot has been made.

 But that is what it does now...*scratches head*

 &gt; It could remember where to put the mouse cursor, it could remember the
 active window when it made the screenshot, and make all those options
 changeable for the current screenshot. That would simplify that thing, and
 would make it much better to use IMO.

 You would have to elaborate on this, because I'm not sure what you mean.
 Do you mean the options would include a list of windows on the screen and
 you choose which one to make active before the screenshot is taken? Also
 do you really need to restore the mouse position?

 &gt; For that, the tool that makes the screenshot could be a simple command
 line utility, that optionally runs the Screenshot application, and gives
 that one all the info it needs. Only if you run the Screenshot application
 manually, the application could work similar to what it does now (but
 could also still quit itself, and run the screenshot command line utility
 for the shot itself in order to be hidden from the Deskbar menu).

 That sounds sort of complicated and circular (the command-line utility
 calls the app and the app calls the command-line utility), but overall it
 sounds like it would be better. I'd have to think about it though.

 Unless Julun is around and wants to tackle all this himself.
