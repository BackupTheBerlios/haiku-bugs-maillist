 Replying to [comment:4 meianoite]:
 &gt; Replying to [comment:3 bonefish]:
 &gt; &gt; I don't get the point of this ticket. Please elaborate.
 &gt;
 &gt; First and foremost, it's an enhancement ticket, not a bug report. Maybe
 what I find to be &quot;enhanced&quot; behaviour is actually considered undesirable
 by you or other developers, but my rationale is as follows:
 &gt;
 &gt; If you invoje jam with the -a option, it will re-download packages
 unconditionally. Since I had to do it quite a number of times today
 because of what became #4070 (to check that I wasn't messing up somewhere
 else), I thought it would be better for both the servers' bandwidth, and
 my monthly download limit, if those files weren't redownloaded in case
 they were identical.

 Mmh, I don't think I've ever built an image with &quot;-a&quot;. I usually just
 remove the &quot;objects&quot; directory and built normally, which also has the
 advantage of removing all the files that the build system doesn't know
 about anymore.

 &gt; Ideally the build system would invoke a port of the to-become Haiku
 packaging system to check for new versions of packages along with a more
 robust check of md5/sha1 signatures, and download remote packages only
 when they differ from the local copy, but I figured that for the time
 being the timestamping option of wget would suffice.

 Actually the files at the URLs are not intended to change. If a new
 version of a package is built, it gets a new (unique) name and
 OptionalPackages is adjusted accordingly. The point is that the build
 system is supposed to define the the contents of the image, not &quot;third
 parties&quot; swapping optional package files behind the scenes. So IMO the
 timestamp change is superfluous. Either we decide not to let the build
 system update downloads ever -- then the files could simply be marked
 NoUpdate -- or we are fine with &quot;-a&quot; updating them (which is consistent
 behavior) and tell people not to build jam with &quot;-a&quot;, if they don't want
 that to happen.

 Regarding your patch. pushd/popd are superfluous, since actions are run in
 separate shells anyway.
