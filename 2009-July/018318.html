 Replying to [comment:5 bonefish]:
 &gt; Mmh, I don't think I've ever built an image with &quot;-a&quot;. I usually just
 remove the &quot;objects&quot; directory and built normally, which also has the
 advantage of removing all the files that the build system doesn't know
 about anymore.

 Hmm... Good point. What about the build/*cache files? Does it matter if I
 leave them there or erase them? I figure jam -a recreates those.

 &gt; Actually the files at the URLs are not intended to change. If a new
 version of a package is built, it gets a new (unique) name and
 OptionalPackages is adjusted accordingly.

 Well, yeah, but has the side-effect of leaving old packages behind on the
 download directory.

 &gt; The point is that the build system is supposed to define the the
 contents of the image, not &quot;third parties&quot; swapping optional package files
 behind the scenes. So IMO the timestamp change is superfluous. Either we
 decide not to let the build system update downloads ever -- then the files
 could simply be marked NoUpdate -- or we are fine with &quot;-a&quot; updating them
 (which is consistent behavior) and tell people not to build jam with &quot;-a&quot;,
 if they don't want that to happen.

 I think I like the NoUpdate option better. We're then consistent with
 rebuilding everything the build system *generates*, while leaving what it
 *imports* alone.

 &gt; Regarding your patch. pushd/popd are superfluous, since actions are run
 in separate shells anyway.

 I wouldn't count that as a patch, actually :) Just pseudocode. I have no
 idea if invoking a subshell via backticks would work. Anyway, it's still
 necessary to cd into the downloads directory when invoking wget with -N,
 but I figure it's more robust to cd into $(HAIKU_DOWNLOAD_DIR) anyway.

 Replying to [comment:6 umccullough]:
 &gt; FWIW, you could also modify your UserBuildConfig such that optional
 packages are only included when using a build profile where @disk is
 defined with the optional packages in a conditional block based on the
 profilename.
 &gt;
 &gt; Furthermore, you could define a build profile that intentionally
 excludes them.
 &gt;
 &gt; I don't know, it seems like it's not that big of a deal, and easily
 worked around if desired.

 Hey, this is just brilliant! Thanks! :D

 Closing as invalid since I too find this to be the best solution to my
 problem.
