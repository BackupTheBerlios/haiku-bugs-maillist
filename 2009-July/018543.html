 Replying to [comment:4 leavengood]:
 &gt; But that is what it does now...*scratches head*

 I guess I could have made that clearer :-)

 &gt; You would have to elaborate on this, because I'm not sure what you mean.
 Do you mean the options would include a list of windows on the screen and
 you choose which one to make active before the screenshot is taken? Also
 do you really need to restore the mouse position?

 Right now, there is a strange &quot;Options&quot; page (that isn't really about
 options, mostly), and one that actually has something to do with the
 screenshot made.
 I would merge the two panels into one, with two different modes depending
 on whether the Screenshot application was launched, or the Print-Screen
 key was pressed.

 When you press the key, the window should come up (after the shot has been
 taken), and you should then still be able to select if the whole shot
 should be saved, or only the (then) active window. Same thing for the
 inclusion of the mouse cursor at that time. There is no reason to not be
 able to change these settings afterwards, and it's a lot more convenient
 to do so after the fact. The screenshot preview should actually show
 what's saved then (ie. the window only, etc.).

 Also, I would make it an option to suppress the window completely, and
 generally show it to the user.

 If you just launch the Screenshot application, it should not show a
 screenshot preview, because there is none yet. Instead, the delayed
 screenshot option should be displayed (but not with a simple BTextControl,
 a slider (or +/- buttons) would be way more convenient here), along with
 the &quot;Take shot&quot; button.

 There should not be this strange duality of the panels; they don't go
 along with each other well, and don't have much to do with each other,
 either, ATM.

 &gt; That sounds sort of complicated and circular (the command-line utility
 calls the app and the app calls the command-line utility), but overall it
 sounds like it would be better. I'd have to think about it though.

 It's definitely circular, but it's not *that* complicated and would get
 the job done, at least :-)
