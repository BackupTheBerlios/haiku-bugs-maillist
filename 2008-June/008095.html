Comment (by mmlr):

 The difference is that usb_disk does the minimal SCSI that is required
 itself and directly publishes a block device to the system. The usb_scsi
 on the other hand is a bridge between the SCSI subsystem and the USB
 device. It takes SCSI commands from the SCSI subsystem and pushes them to
 the USB driver and back. So usb_scsi does not publish the drive itself, it
 gets published by the SCSI subsystem (or rather scsi_disk / scsi_cd) and
 then looks like a normal SCSI device to the rest of the system. This
 approach has a more of an overhead and generally is more complexity, but
 essentially reduces the amount of work usb_scsi has to do (as it is more
 like a pass through - not counting having to work around device bugs and
 translating incompatible protocols). The advantage of it being that for
 example a USB CD writer could be supported by the existing SCSI system and
 transparently through scsi_cd. When not using usb_scsi you would have to
 write an individual usb_cd driver that would then be publishing the CD
 drive and export this functionality.

 On the subject of the new driver architecture. That it is in place does
 not change much directly. First the USB stack has also to be ported to it
 (while leaving the existing API intact). This alone poses a few, not yet
 solved, problems though. It is not yet clear to me what the best way to
 publish devices through the new architecture is, as there is no real model
 on how multi function devices are supposed to be presented.

 When the USB stack is available through the new driver architecture this
 does still not mean that usb_scsi is available. It only solves the problem
 of when it gets loaded and by whom. The real work is still, as would be
 right now, porting the usb_scsi driver to the new SCSI interface.
 Incidentally moving to the new driver architecture makes it more work, as
 also the USB part has to be ported (the USB interface would have been the
 same with the old model, avoiding the need to port).

 Since usb_disk works good enough for now (and in fact, as other protocols
 are not too common in newer devices anymore because they are discouraged
 by Microsoft for example, it should be pretty future proof), I don't think
 that this task is highly urgent. Eventually it will make sense to port it
 for the aforementioned advantages it brings though.
