Comment:

 But Haiku cannot, as it has no provision to do so. Just unmounting all
 volumes does not really indicate you want to remove the device. It would
 be perfectly fine for you to remount the volume, or mount another
 partition/card provided by the same device. If the volume was properly
 unmounted though there is no reason for a surprise disconnect to be
 unsafe. If there is data corruption occuring then the device would be
 using a cache but doesn't implement the synchronize command. This is
 highly unlikely though as the benefit of a cache for memory cards is
 marginal at best. USB devices are made for hot-plugging and surprise
 removal and as long as there is no cache involved that doesn't get flushed
 there should be no issues.

 What makes you think the device needs the actual power off from the port?
 It's probably just a reminder to use &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; under
 Windows, as there is no other way to unmount a volume under Windows
 (except for removing the drive letter through the device manager). This
 does not really apply to Haiku or other systems though that do provide
 means to explicitly mount/unmount. Interesting to see would be how Linux
 behaves in that situation. It might take unmounting all volumes as a
 device shutdown.

 I am closing this as invalid. If data corruption actually happens, please
 reopen this, as then there is a bug somewhere. If you have reasons to
 believe not shutting down port power leads to problems, please open an
 enhancement ticket to implement a way to explicitly shut down USB ports,
 as there currently is none. This will probably require an API change
 though, so it won't happen too soon.
