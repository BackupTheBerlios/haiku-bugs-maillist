Comment:

 I'm sorry to report that it is highly unlikely that I will be able to
 implement this. I did a few attempts and thought through a few possible
 ways to go about this, but the problems are many fold and not really
 solvable.

 First of all, while EHCI provides theoretical means (by the spec) to hand
 over the controller back to BIOS/firmware, there is no such provision in
 UHCI where the keyboards will usually be attached to. Also even the EHCI
 possibility seems not really supported anywhere and all the code in other
 OSes I checked do not handle this case at all or the corresponding code is
 simply disabled. It seems to me that there is no actual BIOS/firmware
 implementation that would reinitialize the legacy support by other means
 than rebooting. I have tried to simply reenable the legacy support bits
 for UHCI, but that cannot realistically work, as the BIOS couldn't really
 do anything as the schedules, controller setup and even device state is
 completely different from what the BIOS initializes it to when booting.

 Then there is the more general problem of how to handle enter/leave
 conditions. Even if it was possible to hand over the controller back to
 the BIOS it would require the BIOS to reset the controller, do a
 redetection of the devices and then reenable legacy emulation through the
 PS/2 ports. That's a pretty big thing to handle which is unlikely to be
 present in most BIOSes and judging from how badly implemented legacy
 support itself in general is, I wouldn't put any hopes in such a process
 even if it existed.

 Leaving KDL again after such a thing would also be pretty straight
 impossible. The controller would suddenly be in a completely different
 state than what the driver expects. It would require detecting this and
 doing clean resets. Again from judging how badly legacy handoff is
 generally implemented this would probably turn out to be very fragile if
 possible at all.

 The more probable thing to happen would be if we wrote a KDL USB stack
 with modified controller drivers that work purely in polling mode. This is
 a huge task however, as you would essentially have to write a complete USB
 stack, host controller drivers and a hid driver inside the kernel debugger
 (not even thinking about the dependency on PCI and how to enumerate and
 reset the controllers). You would even need to partially support the
 unused EHCI as you have to kick it off so the companion host controllers
 get the lowspeed devices at all.

 I don't really see myself doing this as the required effort would be huge
 for a relatively small gain. The better alternative in those cases would
 be to simply disable USB completely by removing the host controller
 drivers and then just use legacy emulation all the time, including KDL. So
 I will close this enhancement now as it is a bit unrealistic having
 thought it through. Have to close this as invalid however as there is no
 &quot;wontfix&quot;.
