Comment(by mmlr):

 Replying to [comment:6 idefix]:
 &gt; It doesn't hang at boot any more, but the serial log is continually
 filled with errors, see seriallog3.txt.[[BR]]
 &gt; Haiku does recognize the cardreader though, see usb_dev_info.txt.

 That looks a bit strange to me. The continued errors are triggered by
 polling for media changes. This triggers a TEST_UNIT_READY SCSI command on
 the device, that is apparently not supported or doesn't work when there
 are no media in the reader. What really surprises me though is that
 apparently clearing the stall conditions after a mass storage reset
 results in a stall response. Looking at the tokens in the log the only
 thing I can guess is that the last phase of the request to clear the halt
 condition is stalled by the device, as the tokens indicate inbound traffic
 with no data on endpoint 0, which is only the case for exactly these
 requests.

 As the device info seems to be still readable from usb_dev_info the device
 and the UHCI controller are in fact not blocked. So the question is, when
 you insert a card into that card reader, are you able to mount and use it?
 If it is usable, then I could imagine the device to just stall the clear
 requests if the bulk pipes aren't actually halted, to indicate that a
 clear wouldn't have been necessary. In that case they could simply be
 ignored.

 The different errors that get output with the wacom device, they do only
 show up as soon as you unplug that wacom device again, right? If so that's
 normal and can be ignored. While the stack and the driver haven't yet
 noticed the removal of the device they will continue using it resulting in
 failing transfer descriptors. That stops as soon as the device disconnect
 is handled. If they come up while the device is plugged in this would
 indicate some other problem. Again the question, does the wacom device
 work while you have it plugged?
