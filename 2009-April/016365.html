Comment(by rudolfc):

 Hi again, and sorry for the delays from here.. :-/

 -&gt; @ AndreasF:
 I just looked over your logfiles. The file with 5 attempts doesn't seem
 strange to me. The last boot does not differ from the first two AFAICT in
 a sense that explains the VGA screen only working in the last boot.

 The DFP panel boot seems normal too: there's one 'anomaly': you specified
 in nvidia.settings not to program the panel. In some cases that could mean
 you won't get a picture on the panel (and in some cases it's vice versa).

 About (un)plugging DFP panels (or other screens) during power-up time: the
 driver does *not* support hot-plugging. if it works for someone, then
 he/she's just lucky.

 While in theory it can be done for VGA and TV screens, this is not the
 case for DVI/HDMI panels since the driver isn't capable of programming the
 specific link hardware (yet?). This means the driver has to rely on the
 pre-programming the VGA BIOS does during POST. Hence: no hot-plugging (and
 thus no pluggin during soft/warm restart).

 Now that you know this, I have some questions:
 - did the DVI panel work or not? Did you try without the nvidia.settings
 option to not program the panel too?
 - so VGA sometimes works, and sometimes it does not? Did you test this
 with *only* the VGA screen connected? (remove the TVout and DVI/HDMI
 cables before testing, and make sure you always use the same port for the
 VGA screen: since one port may work, while the other may not..)
 If you did not do testing this way, it's best you start clean to get real
 clear info.

 A hint: try with a vesa settings file in place, set at the
 resolution/colordepth you use in haiku. Does that solve the problem?

 -&gt; @ JeremyVisser:
 Hi, could you post complete logs for me as requested before? Your system
 might suffer from another problem..
 Good hint BTW about Haiku remembering the setting for each screen
 (system). I did not know/suspect that yet.

 I'm afraid Haiku is 'strange' in more ways compared to BeOS: For instance,
 I hear Haiku double bufferes the screen. Which means it sets a double-
 height virtual resolution for every mode you use. On cards with low
 amounts of mem this could mean not all resolutions are avaible
 (theoretical problem these days I guess though :)

 Another thing: Haiku issues a VESA modecall at the very beginning of the
 boot. This is not done by BeOS *unless* the user specifically requests it
 (via vesa settings file). I think haiku sets a mode it wants to set (the
 'native' mode of a DVI panel for instance). This is not depending on the
 vesa settings file. If this file is there as well, I can imagine (don't
 know unfortunately) Haiku issuing a second call. Only after those calls
 are done the actual display driver comes into play.

 (un)fortunately, this means that the state the hardware is in, is not that
 simple anymore and the driver apparantly makes wrong assumtions therefore.
 I (we) need to find out what's apparantly missing (if so..?!?) to make
 this driver work better on Haiku. Haiku is nolonger comparable to BeOS in
 this fashion. And on BeOS the driver might work perfectly for your
 hardware.

 Bye!

 Rudolf.
