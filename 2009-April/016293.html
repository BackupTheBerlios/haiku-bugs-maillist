Comment(by bonefish):

 Replying to [comment:12 anevilyak]:
 &gt; I'm guessing this is most likely a flaw in the preemption logic itself,
 since I can vouch for the fact that the exact same flaw shows up in
 scheduler_affine, and the decision making process for when to preempt is
 one of the few things that was left entirely untouched when creating that
 scheduler.

 Mmh, that doesn't quite convince me. We have a fixed quantum of 3 ms after
 which we reschedule and we reschedule in release_sem_etc(), if a thread
 with a higher priority has been woken up (and B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE was not
 set), as well as when sending signals (needs some fixing, but is
 relatively rare anyway).

 For the realtime thread with the highest priority in a busy system one
 would thus expect an average latency of half a quantum, i.e. 1.5 ms.
 Unless I've overlooked one, that would be the &quot;Extended PS/2 Mouse 1
 watcher&quot; with a priority of 104. According to the data its average latency
 was almost 6.7 ms, though. That's more than two quanta, which shouldn't
 really happen, since at the end of the quantum of the thread that woke up
 the &quot;Extended PS/2 Mouse 1 watcher&quot; it would have been scheduled for sure.
 The (priority 103) &quot;_input_server_event_loop_&quot; thread's average latency is
 2.9 ms, which is least less than a quantum, but also greater than I would
 expect.

 Regarding the mystery that almost every thread seems to do I/O, that can
 actually be easily explained: Apparently the memory pressure is high
 enough that read-only memory mapped executable pages are discarded, even
 ones that are not really &quot;inactive&quot;. Hence we get a lot of page faults
 that need to re-read the pages into memory. This would also explain why
 the system is so unusable.
