Comment(by anevilyak):

 Replying to [comment:13 bonefish]:
 &gt; Mmh, that doesn't quite convince me. We have a fixed quantum of 3 ms
 after which we reschedule and we reschedule in release_sem_etc(), if a
 thread with a higher priority has been woken up (and B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE
 was not set), as well as when sending signals (needs some fixing, but is
 relatively rare anyway).
 &gt;

 Is it possible we're setting B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE in some cases where we
 shouldn't be?

 &gt; Regarding the mystery that almost every thread seems to do I/O, that can
 actually be easily explained: Apparently the memory pressure is high
 enough that read-only memory mapped executable pages are discarded, even
 ones that are not really &quot;inactive&quot;. Hence we get a lot of page faults
 that need to re-read the pages into memory. This would also explain why
 the system is so unusable.

 I can confirm this behavior here as well. With your and Axel's changes the
 system does indeed now recover after 3-5 seconds (nice work!) of being
 unresponsive, though it's quite obvious all apps have been swapped out by
 the behavior afterwards (the first click to Deskbar takes several seconds
 to respond while it's paged back in for instance). What puzzles me is why
 memory pressure is being exerted in this manner at all. I would have
 assumed the VM would discard file cache pages/buffers before going after
 executables, so I would expect the inode being created/filled in this
 instance to have its pages flushed and reused once the pressure gets to
 that point. Is this not the case?
