Comment(by majie):

 Replying to [comment:4 stippi]:
 &gt; I've looked into the patch, and you have done a lot of good work. I
 would go ahead and commit this, but you said you wanted to mention the
 libhttpd license in AboutSystem? I can do this for you, just tell me.
 &gt;

 Yes, please help me update the About System app. License declarations can
 be obtained from libhttpd.c. A copy of the license should be placed in
 /data/etc/licenses. Thank you.

 &gt; Here are a few things I noticed when testing Poorman a bit:
 &gt; * On first start, when no settings were present, Poorman correctly
 prompted me to specify the public html folder, but when I clicked on
 Specify, the main window opened, as well as the file requester to pick the
 folder. Picking the folder was then ignored, I had to go into the settings
 and pick it again.
 &gt;

 My fault. I'll fix it.

 &gt; * When serving websites with UTF-8 content, Firefox will not display the
 multi-byte chars correctly. When I load the same page from disk, it works
 just fine.
 &gt;

 Thttpd don't have the ability to detect the encoding of an text file. The
 Content-Type header confuses firefox which chooses a false encoding to
 decode the text. There is a walk around. I'll fix this when I finish my
 gsoc application.

 &gt; About the patch itself:
 &gt; * There are a lot of coding style violations (in the old code but also
 in the new code). Do you intend to work on those yet?
 &gt;

 I'm trying to follow the haiku coding guidelines in the codes I wrote, but
 I didn't mean to modify the old codes.

 &gt; * As with so many apps, the interface would improve a lot if it used the
 new Haiku layout-management. The code would become much simpler and easier
 to maintain/extend as well.
 &gt;
 &gt; Anyways, thanks a lot for this work, it's greatly appreciated!

 The gui stub was originally developed on r5. But haiku uses a new font
 with a larger size. I used to develop java programs and I know that layout
 managers are good things. When I picked up the codes I thought I should
 fix the gui problem. But later I realised I should put more works to the
 httpd codes. In fact, this is a high priority item in my TODO list. I'll
 fix it when I have time.

 With the two problems above(coding style and layout manager) plus the
 unclear license declaration, I wonder whether the gui needs to be
 completely rewritten in the future.
