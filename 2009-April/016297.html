Comment(by bonefish):

 Replying to [comment:14 stippi]:
 &gt; Interesting. If the read-only executable pages had been discarded for
 any high-priority threads, wouldn't that affect their latency also?

 No, latency is just the time from the thread waking up (after sleep,
 waiting on a semaphore,...) to it starting to run. The additional page
 faults re-reading the executable page just make it run slower and
 additionally wait for I/O.

 Replying to [comment:15 anevilyak]:
 &gt; I can confirm this behavior here as well. With your and Axel's changes
 the system does indeed now recover after 3-5 seconds (nice work!) of being
 unresponsive,

 It took quite a bit longer to recover in my test, but I suspect that also
 depends on the size of the image file, the total amount of memory etc.

 &gt; though it's quite obvious all apps have been swapped out by the behavior
 afterwards (the first click to Deskbar takes several seconds to respond
 while it's paged back in for instance). What puzzles me is why memory
 pressure is being exerted in this manner at all. I would have assumed the
 VM would discard file cache pages/buffers before going after executables,
 so I would expect the inode being created/filled in this instance to have
 its pages flushed and reused once the pressure gets to that point. Is this
 not the case?

 ATM the VM treats mapped and just cached files pretty much the same.
 Mapped pages get an initially higher usage count and therefore won't be
 evicted as quickly, but after two iterations of the page daemon without
 being touched they are back to zero, too and become available for
 recycling.
