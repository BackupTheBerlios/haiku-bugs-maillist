Comment(by cebif):

 Replying to [comment:24 axeld]:
 &gt; Have you read the summary or the description? It clearly mentions CDs
 and DVDs as well as iso9660, and nothing more. How could it be clear that
 this bug was about everything else?
 &gt;
 &gt; While it's technically allowed for you to reopen bugs, it's just
 annoying when you do so incorrectly. When in doubt, just ask before. This
 was an iso9660 specific bug, and it has been fixed. This is clearly
 visible by the component this bug has been assigned to as well as the
 changeset that fixed it.
 &gt;
 &gt; If the CD appears empty, than this is just another bug in iso9660.
 &gt;
 &gt; If your SD card let's you drop into KDL, this is not a problem of
 iso9660.

 Sorry for feeling a bit hot here. I'm the one that reported this bug I
 should know what I stated and meant. I know I stated iso9660 as one of the
 file systems but I wasn't saying that it was a file system specific bug.
 At that point I wasn't certain. I was wanting to test more as shown in a
 slightly later comment to emitrax:


 &quot;Replying to emitrax:

     Sorry, by iso I mean tha haiku image.

 No, I did not compile a haiku image. The crash happens with different
 types of file systems but I have only tested with iso9660, DVD movie and a
 DVD+RW I burned but not certain of its fs. Is udf in DVD movie? I will
 have to check what the different fs types are on the disks.&quot;
 Although I didn't say it outright I was more under the impression it was a
 tracker type bug, as stated outright by emitrax.
 In my initial report I had the component as: libroot.so. I'm not saying
 you should have left it at that (I know you're knowledge is greater) but
 that shows I wasn't saying the component was iso9660.
 Yes I probably should have asked again. I did ask once but this whole
 comment (that I asked it in can be looked at as invalid because I had the
 wrong image). Sorry for not doing that. I was feeling frustrated because
 one other bug I reported before this was almost immediately marked as copy
 (not by you) when there was crucial difference. I asked to reopen it and
 the reason why but have not had a reply in weeks. Any way that particular
 bug is really fixed now.
 Is my bug or any one elses vanity.
