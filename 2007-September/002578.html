 Reporter:  scottmc          |       Owner:  marcusoverhagen
     Type:  bug              |      Status:  new            
 Priority:  normal           |   Milestone:  R1             
Component:  - Audio &amp; Video  |     Version:  R1 development 
 Platform:  All              |  
-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------
 I'm attaching 3 file of puzzles I entered from a book that I know contains
 &quot;defective&quot; puzzles.  The symetric error files have a pair of square that
 could be interchanged giving the puzzle two possible solutions.  The Haiku
 sudoku is able to &quot;solve&quot; it, assuming one of the two spots it seems.  But
 it you put in the other option it solves it for the other solution.  Not
 sure if this is a problem or not.  I haven't checked around so see how
 this is handled, that is, is this even a valid puzzle or is the book i
 have just filled with defective puzzles.  I'm betting that is the case.
 The last one is one I haven't finshed myself but I entered it into the
 program and clicked solved and it seems to have locked up, either that or
 it is taking an aweful long time to solve it.  That one is labeled test36,
 since it was #36 in the book i had.  I'll try putting in a few more puzzle
 I located in that book that I know are wrong, such as ones that were
 misprinted.. should be a good test to run the game through to verify that
 it's able to handle bad input correctly ;)
 Yeah we're here kicking the tires.
