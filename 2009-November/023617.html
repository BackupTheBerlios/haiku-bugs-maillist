 Replying to [comment:6 axeld]:
 &gt; To Koki:
 &gt;
 &gt; Konatu is not a proportional font (and I don't claim it would be), but
 it is not a monospaced font either, as not all of its characters have the
 same width - what's so hard to understand about this?

 Look, Axel, I am not stupid and I understand what you are saying. But in
 the real world, a font is either proportional or monospaced, and when a
 user installs a monospaced font, he/she expects it to appear in the GUI as
 such. That's all that matters in the end. Period.

 If you want to create an internal categorization to support some form of
 algorithm to make this happen, that's all good; but exposing such
 categorization to the end user serves no purpose (other than perhaps
 confusing them). Or do you actually think that you can convince
 Japanese/Chinese/Korean users that the monospaced fonts they have been
 using for so many years are actually not monospaced fonts?

 &gt; However, on the application level, it has to support this specifically,
 as it simply cannot hanlde Konatu as a monospaced font. Therefore, it
 doesn't make any sense to break our perfectly fine API, and replace it
 with something ambiguous and less powerful that would also break all apps
 that don't properly support fonts like Konatu.

 What would exactly happen if Konatsu were handled as a monospaced font?
 How exactly would that break the API?

 &gt; Calling this differentiation narrow minded just doesn't make any sense.

 It is the definition of monospaced that I am calling narrow-minded,
 because it is western-centric and does not take into account the
 typographic needs of several important languages.  What's so hard to
 understand about this?
