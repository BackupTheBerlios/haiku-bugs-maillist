Comment(by rudolfc):

 Hi again fano,

 The behaviour is OK as much as is possible now.
 - if you only connect your VGA screen then the driver doesn't know it's
 specs since the I2C buses don't work on your card. Therefore the
 app_server takes some failsafe, and you can set resolutions/refreshes not
 supported by the screen (but the card does support them).

 - if you connect both screens, the driver only lets you select resolutions
 supported by both screens. It assumes the VGA is a 4:3 so all WS modes are
 not selectable. All 4:3 modes your TV can display are selectable,
 according to the reported specs of your screen by the GPU programming done
 by the VGA card's BIOS it can do max. 1280x720: so only 640x480 and
 800x600 are selectable.

 - if you only connect your HDTV then you can select WS modes 16:10 and
 16:9 supported by the TV's reported resolution: so also 1280x720. This is
 the max the driver can do for your TV since the driver uses the pre-
 programmed GPU DVI link which is set at that resolution.

 - I checked your TV: it's indeed a 1920x1080 panel. If the BIOS would
 program your card for this resolution the driver would allow you the
 option if you only connect your TV. The only advice I can give you here is
 to check your DVI cable connector: is it a fully pinned version (so dual
 link)? IF it isn't please find a duallink cable for testing if possible:
 it might be that the card's BIOS sets the fullHD mode if it finds such a
 cable.

 If that's not done, or not possible you can do max. 1280x720.

 Please note that the refresh is not programmed for the TV. You can enable
 refresh programming via nvidia.settings, but even then it will program for
 fixed 60Hz.

 Maybe I could remove that limitation and let it program the refresh the
 user selects, but probably only if DDC/EDID works since that gives the
 valid refreshrate options.
 Since the I2C buses don't work with my driver on your card I don't have
 this info at my disposal (the driver that is :).

 At this time the only real bug left in the driver for your card is the
 lack of working I2C buses. That I can't fix without access to a non-
 functional card in this respect.. And I don't have such a card.

 Anyhow, I'm glad we could get this far :-) !!

 I'm awaiting your dualhead tests, and I think we could close this ticket
 afterwards since the original fault is now gone.

 Awaiting your reply.


 Greetings,

 Rudolf.
