Comment (by bonefish):

 Replying to [comment:5 jonas.kirilla]:
 &gt; No joke. Is it really that ridiculous? :]
 &gt;
 &gt; I've seen people report that they've run out of inodes when building
 large projects on UFS (ext2 is similar, IIRC) and the Haiku build isn't
 small anymore.

 I actually didn't think that there are any current FSs (no, this
 definitely doesn't include UFS) that still have an inode limit (other than
 the number of free blocks). ext3 does have a specifiable limit, the
 default being 1 file per block (for 4KB blocks at least), AFAIK. ReiserFS
 doesn't even have inodes.

 &gt; I don't know if the configure script is a good place for it, but it
 might still be a good idea in theory to have the build try to estimate
 whether or not the host system has a fair chance  at finishing the task at
 hand. Why spend hours of CPU and disk, and then fail, if it was already
 easily known before-hand!

 Er, building a complete Haiku image (not including the buildtools) takes a
 little less than 15 min on my desktop machine, which is by no means
 current (P4 3.2 GHz). Besides, the time is not lost. You can simply free
 some disk space and jam again, continuing at the point where you stopped.

 &gt; If it's not easily known before-hand, then I suppose this feature
 request is stillborn, but if a disk is obviously too small or it's already
 low on inodes and this can be measured? (I'm guessing it can be.)
 &gt;
 &gt; Anyway, perhaps it's not worth the effort.

 I don't think it is. Adding the checks is one thing, but since Haiku keeps
 growing one would also have to adjust the numbers from time to time.

 Anyway, it is way more likely to run out of inodes or disk space while
 checking out the haiku and buildtools sources than while building. A bit
 of statistics, after running a &quot;jam -q haiku-vmware-image&quot;:

 total number of files:
 generated: 15025
 haiku sources (without generated): 33639
 buildtools sources: 27941
 ratio sources/generated: 4.1

 total disk space:
 generated: 433029 KB
 haiku sources (without generated): 867145 KB
 buildtools sources: 1046479 KB
 ratio sources/generated: 4.77

 BTW, that also shows, that removing the buildtools sources after building
 the tools gives you more than enough room for building the image.
