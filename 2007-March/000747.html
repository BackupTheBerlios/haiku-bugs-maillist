Comment (by stippi):

 Hi,

 if someone manages to get gprof/bprof working properly on R5 (for use in
 the test environment), that would be great. Don't forget to tell me how...
 :-)

 I did manage to get some useful info from ezprof, but I fixed all issues
 to the point that the info retrieved from ezprof is now pretty much
 inconclusive.

 I have thought very much about the performance issues, and have come to
 the conclusion, that the problem could very well be in the way &quot;update
 sessions&quot; work. Currently, the app_server maintains repainting on the
 *window* level of things. There are two update sessions (per window): a
 current and a pending update session. The client window paints views in
 the current update session which touch the dirty region. The problem here
 is, that the mechanism is probably too &quot;coarse&quot;: The update session cannot
 grow after the window has been informed that repainting needs to be done.
 So additional dirty regions are placed in the next (pending) update
 session. When the window finally gets to repainting a particular view
 after having painted a few views, large portions of it might already be
 dirty in the next update session. So it has to be painted again. If the
 update sessions worked on the *view* level, instead of the window level
 (as seems to be the case in R5, since there is one update message per
 view), the dirty region (for each view) might grow for a much longer time
 on the server side (while the client window is busy painting other views),
 and the window might have to paint the view only once.

 I have yet to think of a way, how the update stuff can be moved to the
 view level, without wasting too much resources for all those regions. But
 I think this is defenitely one very important reason for the current
 &quot;slowness&quot; of the app_server. The drawing speed itself is likely not the
 problem for the majority of the views you see during typical use.

 HTH, Stephan
