  Reporter:  kaoutsis   |       Owner:  axeld         
      Type:  bug        |      Status:  new           
  Priority:  normal     |   Milestone:  R1            
 Component:  - General  |     Version:  R1 development
Resolution:             |    Platform:  All           
------------------------+---------------------------------------------------
Comment (by kaoutsis):

 additions:
 * Opening the mails with the Mail program to read the contents
 (from within haiku), the mails have subjects.

 * Booting the r5 retrieving my mails again from mail server,
 i get the same mails correctly (with subjects and the rest).

 * All the mails that have been fetched from r5 (mounting the r5 volume
 from a running haiku machine)
 are displayed correctly in the Tracker window (from within haiku),
 except of course from those that have been fetched from the haiku machine!

 i hope that i gave an idea of the bug!
